How can it be associated with art and content? How can we let it determine what will be successful and what will not?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cLet me explain with an example,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was in a three-hour film about a physicist, which had the that impact it had \u2013 the algorithms probably wouldn\u2019t have grasped it. My hope is that \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 and similar projects are not considered anomalies, that we stop translating creative experience into diagrams.\u201d<\/p><p>Gosling was quick to jump in, adding: \u201cYou can\u2019t beat an algorithm at its job. And this, paradoxically, forces me to be more human, to choose \u2018handmade\u2019 projects like \u2018The Fall Guy,\u2019 which is based on personal experiences, our footprints and our stories, which we poured into the characters.\u201d<\/p><p>Nolan \u2014 who has made a name for himself as an film auteur who can still get lots of funding from studios \u2014 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.empireonline.com\/movies\/news\/christopher-nolan-reflects-year-of-oppenheimer-exclusive\/\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a>: \u201cI\u2019ve just made a three-hour film about Robert Oppenheimer which is R-rated and half in black-and-white \u2013 and it made a billion dollars. Of course I think films are doing great.\"<\/p><p>\u201cThe crazy thing is that it\u2019s literally the most successful film I\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019ve been doing this for 20 years and in the United Kingdom it\u2019s my highest-grossing film. So I feel great about the state of the movie business, based on my own experience. But also based on seeing other movies break out, seeing audiences come back.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cThe audience\u2019s desire to be surprised, to see something new, to see something they did not know they wanted, that\u2019s always been the most powerful force in theatrical film,\u201d Nolan added. <\/p><p>\u201cSo it was wonderful to see that this year.\u201d<\/p><p>This development comes as Hollywood production companies appear to be investing in films based on books, comic books, or other intellectual property. <\/p><p>Nolan's \"Oppenheimer\" was based on a biographical book called \"American Prometheus,\" written by Kai Bird. <\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

Unlike some of these other apps, Meta has made their AI available for free within their social media platforms. <\/p><p>The Times reported that this represented the \"most aggressive push yet from a big tech company to bring this flavor of artificial intelligence \u2014 known as generative A.I. \u2014 to the mainstream.\"<\/p><p>Zuckerberg took to Instagram on Thursday, writing: \"We believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use.\"<\/p><p>Brian Chen \u2014 the author of the Times piece \u2014 suggested that it would be best for users of Meta AI to approach it \"with caution,\" noting that it \"makes lots of mistakes when you treat it as a search engine.\"<\/p><p>Some have suggested that it is best to just use the bot for fun, including \"express[ing] yourself when chatting with friends.\"<\/p><p>One Meta spokeswoman said that since the technology is new, it may not garner the most accurate responses. Despite this flaw, there is currently no way to shut off Meta AI while inside of Meta's social media apps.<\/p><p>Tech Crunch concluded: \"Meta has positioned its AI as a first layer for casual questions, and it does work. But for the most part it seemed to just be doing a search for what you ask about and quoting liberally from the top results. And half the time it included the search at the end anyway. So why not just use Google or Bing in the first place?\"<\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

He fled on foot and allegedly ran into Tinnin's home at about 9:30 p.m.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cI jumped over this couch, and we met there by the front door,\" the grandmom told KRQE-TV. \"That\u2019s when he grabbed me and was upset and said to give him my keys.

The report found that they were infected despite not having any other HIV risk factors and determined that the operations were to blame. <\/p><p>Vampire facials involve blood being drawn from the client's arm and platelets being removed from the blood and injected into the patients with microneedles. The process is intended to rejuvenate the skin and clear away acne and wrinkles. <\/p><p>\n\tThe CDC report said as many as 59 clients could have been exposed to HIV through the facials and Botox injections at a business in Albuquerque that was unlicensed and didn't use appropriate safety measures. <\/p><p>\n\tWhile the report did not name the clinic, KRQE-TV reported that VIP Spa owner Maria Ramos de Ruiz pleaded guilty to several felony counts of practicing without a license in 2022 and was sentenced to serve three and a half years in prison. The New Mexico Department of Health also shut down her spa in 2018 after finding unlabeled blood tubes on a kitchen counter and injectables stored in a kitchen refrigerator next to food. <\/p><p>De Ruiz is currently incarcerated at Springer Correctional Center. <\/p><p>In addition to the three HIV positive cases, two other infections were linked to the clinic through \"direct or indirect connection with services provided at the VIP Spa,\" said a department spokesperson. <\/p><p>A new case of HIV infection linked to the clinic <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nbcnews.com\/news\/us-news\/hiv-cases-linked-new-mexico-salon-vampire-facials-rcna93054\" target=\"_blank\">prompted<\/a> the department to tell past clients to be tested for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, even if they had previously tested negative. <\/p><p>\"It\u2019s very important that we spread the word and remind people who received any kind of injection related to services provided at the VIP Spa to come in for free and confidential testing,\" said Dr. Laura Parajon, the deputy secretary of the health department. <\/p><p>\n\tThe CDC warns people against seeking treatments and operations at unlicensed spa facilities. <\/p><h2>Here's a news report about the report: <\/h2><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-youtube\">\n        <span class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"9ca8a3581b847e58d3db4dd9979e835d\" style=\"display:block;position:relative;padding-top:56.25%;\"><iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"auto\" lazy-loadable=\"true\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/JhcTVdxDMvc?rel=0\" style=\"position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;\" width=\"100%\"><\/iframe><\/span>\n \n<\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

The Secret Service agent arrived at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland around 9 a.m. as part of a security detail for Vice President Kamala Harris, who was scheduled to depart the base later that morning.<\/p><p>Before Harris ever arrived, Herczeg began exhibiting strange behavior. According to reports, Herczeg gained access to another agent's phone and proceeded to delete apps on it. The man eventually recovered his phone and otherwise went about his business.<\/p><p>Herczeg then allegedly began engaging in other bizarre behavior, such as mumbling to herself and hiding behind curtains. She even reportedly started throwing various items, including feminine napkins, and warning her colleagues that they were \"going to burn in hell and needed to listen to God,\" a source told Susan Crabtree of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.realclearpolitics.com\/articles\/2024\/04\/25\/secret_service_scuffle_prompts_dei_vetting_scrutiny__150846.html\" target=\"_blank\">RealClearPolitics<\/a>.<\/p><p>When the special agent in charge attempted to intervene, Herczeg allegedly began screaming and insisting that other female agents on Harris' security detail would support her and allow her to continue working.<\/p><p>The situation then seemed to reach a tipping point. Agents suggested that Herczeg was suffering from some kind of mental-health episode, and the SAIC relieved Herczeg of her assignment.<\/p><p>Herczeg did not take the news well.<\/p><p>According to Crabtree's reporting, Herczeg chest-bumped the SAIC and tackled him to the ground, where she began punching him repeatedly. Other agents then attempted to restrain Herczeg but harbored concerns because her service weapon was still in its holster.<\/p><p>Eventually, the agents managed to handcuff Herczeg, seize her firearm, and escort her from the premises, Crabtree reported.<\/p><p>\"She snapped entirely,\" a source told RCP.<\/p><p>Agency spokesman Anthony Guglielmi confirmed only that a \"U.S. Secret Service special agent supporting the Vice President\u2019s departure from Joint Base Andrews\" had exhibited \"distressing\" behavior and that the individual had been \"removed from their assignment.\" He gave few other details since the agency is treating the incident as a \"medical matter.\" <\/p><p>\"The U.S. Secret Service takes the safety and health of our employees very seriously,\" he said.<\/p><p>Guglielmi's statement did not name the agent or use pronouns that would give clues about the person's gender. <\/p><p>Guglielmi may not want to discuss the agent's gender, but plenty of other people do. Crabtree noted in a tweet thread about the incident that \"there are DEI concerns among the USSS community about the hiring of this agent.\"<\/p><p>Not only has Herczeg supposedly shown \"other strange behavior before this incident,\" but she may have been hired as part of a recent push to increase the number of female agents. The Secret Service is one of many federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies that have signed onto the <a href=\"https:\/\/30x30initiative.org\/the-30x30-pledge\/\" target=\"_blank\">30x30 Pledge<\/a>, which seeks to have women comprising 30% of their force by 2030.<\/p><div class=\"rm-embed embed-media\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">BREAKING: Sources within the Secret Service community tell me the agent assigned to VP Kamala Harris was armed during the fight - that the gun was secured in the agent's holster until other agents physically restrained the agent and took the gun from the agent's possession. <br\/>I'm\u2026 <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/kxLLOlFy4b\">https:\/\/t.co\/kxLLOlFy4b<\/a><br\/>\u2014 Susan Crabtree (@susancrabtree) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/susancrabtree\/status\/1783221339136143491?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 24, 2024<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\"><\/script><\/div><p>Even with an emphasis on hiring more female agents, Ronald Kessler, a reporter who has covered the Secret Service for some time, believes that Herczeg \"never should have been hired.\"<\/p><p>Indeed, Herczeg has a troubling record. In 2016, when she was a senior corporal with the Dallas Police Department, she filed a $1 million <a href=\"https:\/\/www.msn.com\/en-us\/news\/crime\/kamala-harris-secret-service-officer-who-fought-her-colleagues-claimed-gender-bias-in-1m-lawsuit-while-dallas-cop\/ar-AA1nFsqk\" target=\"_blank\">discrimination lawsuit<\/a>, claiming among other allegations that another officer had assaulted her and other colleagues had \"targeted\" and \"treated [her] less favorably\" because she's a woman. <\/p><p>\"[DPD] tolerates unprofessional behavior such as fraternization and unprofessional male and female working relationships based on an atmosphere which finds the male officer in charge, regardless of rank or ability,\" the lawsuit claimed.<\/p><p>The lawsuit never went anywhere. A trial court dismissed it in 2021, and a Texas appeals court later upheld the lower court's decision. The appeals court then denied a rehearing of the suit the following year.<\/p><p>Kessler said that lawsuit should have been enough to \"exclude\" Herczeg from consideration at the Secret Service. Because the competition to be accepted into the agency is so fierce, \"you really have to have a pristine record,\" he claimed.<\/p><p>Secret Service spokesman Anthony Guglielmi denied that the agency had \"lowered\" its hiring standards so that more women could qualify and thus fulfill the agency's 30X30 Pledge. He called any accusations to the contrary \"categorically false.\" <\/p><p>Herczeg did not respond to the New York Post's request for comment.<\/p><p><em>Like Blaze News?

        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/weekend-watch-a-gentleman-in-moscow-shows-revolution-s-toll.jpg?id=52116815&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=33%2C0%2C279%2C0\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>\n\tA Columbia University protester named <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/04\/26\/nyregion\/columbia-student-protest-zionism.html\" target=\"_blank\">Khymani James<\/a> was recently caught on camera proclaiming that \"Zionists don't deserve to live.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tLike many of the young people currently disrupting campus and civic life around the country, James' grievances go far beyond what's happening in the Gaza strip. He is a committed foe of \"white supremacy\" and an advocate for \"decolonization.\" From his self-description as \"queer,\" one can assume he shares the usual objections to \"heteronormativity\" and a commitment to \"smashing the patriarchy.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tBy now we are used to such posturing. The vagueness of these terms and their near-universal application \u2014 is anything <em>not<\/em>  \"white supremacist? \u2014 makes them comical. Of course, it is also what makes them dangerous.\n<\/p><p>\n\tJames has apologized for his words. Whether or not this apology was sincere, that he was compelled to make it suggests that a certain decorum still prevails. While property, institutions, reputations, and careers may all be destroyed in the name of social justice, extermination of our political enemies is going too far.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOr is it? American popular culture today generally celebrates and encourages revolutionary sentiment, while glossing over its excesses. If \"white supremacy\" \u2014 as embodied by Zionists, Christians, married people, rich people, and even plain old white people \u2014 is such a problem, maybe getting rid of \"whites\" is ultimately the only real solution. Maybe James simply said the quiet part out loud.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe limited series <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9ljfRH8-nuk\" target=\"_blank\">\"A Gentleman in Moscow,\"<\/a> adapted from the 2016 Amor Towles novel of the same name, is the rare entertainment willing to show what happens when a society follows the logic of identity-based resentment to its brutal conclusion.\n<\/p><p>\n\tUnlike the producers of \"The Handmaid's Tale,\" the team behind \"A Gentleman in Moscow\" had actual history to draw upon. The architects of the Russian Revolution did have the opportunity to exterminate their political enemies, a tactic that proved quite efficient, at least for a while.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"A Gentleman in Moscow\" opens in 1921, when the systematic extermination of the aristocratic class was well under way. Ewan McGregor, equipped with a luxuriant mop of hair and an impressive mustache, plays Count Alexander Ilyich Rostov. Having fled the country in 1914, Rostov has made the ill-advised decision to return to Moscow in order to attend to his grandmother.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe first episode opens with Rostov waiting to appear before a Bolshevik tribunal; soon enough the young noble who preceded him is dragged screaming into a courtyard and summarily shot. McGregor plays this scene with powerful, dignified stillness. It is clear he is afraid, yet also clear that he possesses the inner resources to master this fear.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhatever flaws Rostov may have, this opening scene establishes him as a man of courage and conviction. When asked why he lives in the luxury Metropol hotel, Rostov matter-of-factly responds, \"My house was burned down.\" He refuses to grovel to his potential executioners or make any fake shows of solidarity. \"Occupation?\" asks his interlocutor. \"It's not the business of gentlemen to have occupations,\" says Rostov.\n<\/p><p>\n\tNor does he accept his potential executioners' moral framework. Rostov is cool and witty throughout, more than once provoking laughs from the assembled witnesses. The only flash of anger we see from him is when the tribunal accuses him of being a threat to Russia and her people: \"I <em>am<\/em> one of her people.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"A Gentleman in Moscow\" depicts Rostov living up to this claim. What saves him from a bullet to the head is a revolutionary poem attributed to him. Instead of death, Rostov's punishment is permanent house arrest. He will stay confined to the Hotel Metropol (after being moved from his suite to a drafty, spartan attic room); one step outside and he will be shot.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe series then follows Rostov for the next thirty years, bearing his reduced circumstances with admirable fortitude and cheer as his homeland endures the horrors of Stalinism and World War 2. The latter is largely kept off-screen. We spend our time in Rostov's company, and it is charming indeed \u2014 thanks largely to McGregor's winning performance.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWas it \"fair\" that Rostov was born into the kind of wealth that allowed him to converse with eloquence on any number of topics, to discern which French white goes best with fish, and to appreciate music, and literature, and art? Perhaps not, but the Bolshevik answer to such disparity is that nobody should have these advantages; better to eradicate beauty and wit and refinement entirely.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn his 2012 book <a href=\"https:\/\/douglassmith.info\/books\/former-people\/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Former People: The Final Days of the Russian Aristocracy,\"<\/a> Douglas Smith gives a sense of just what was lost when Russia eliminated its ruling class in pursuit of a utopian vision of equality:\n<\/p><blockquote>\n\tThe destruction of the nobility was one of the tragedies of Russian history. For nearly a millennium, the nobility, what the Russians called b\u00e9laya kost\u2019, literally \"white bone\" (our \"blue blood\"), had supplied Russia\u2019s political, military, cultural, and artistic leaders. The nobility had served as the tsars\u2019 counselors and officials, as their generals and officers; the nobility had produced generations of writers, artists, and thinkers, of scholars and scientists, of reformers and revolutionaries. In a society that was slow to develop a middle class, the nobility played a preponderant role in the political, social, and artistic life of the country disproportionate to its relative size. The end of the nobility in Russia marked the end of a long and deservedly proud tradition that created much of what we still think of today as quintessentially Russian, from the grand palaces of St. Petersburg to the country estates surrounding Moscow, from the poetry of Pushkin to the novels of Tolstoy and the music of Rachmaninov.\n<\/blockquote><p>\n\tAmerican society, though organized under far different principles, is no less stratified; it's just that admission to our elite class isn't entirely hereditary. That class' stewardship of our country over the past 250 years may have been a mixed bag; our history is one of glorious achievements and ignominious depredations. Then again, whose history isn't?\n<\/p><p>\n\tRevolutionaries are accomplished at destruction; it's when they're called upon to build that they usually get into trouble. In its poignant evocation of a dying culture, \"A Gentleman in Moscow\" reminds us of this sobering reality.\n<\/p>",

        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/trump-s-attorneys-cross-examine-david-pecker-poke-holes-in-alleged-catch-and-kill-scheme.jpg?id=52116679&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C107%2C0%2C0\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>The prosecution wrapped up its direct examination of its first witness, former publisher at National Enquirer David Pecker, on Thursday, leaving the defense team some time to begin its cross-examination the same day.<br\/><\/p><p>On Friday, Emil Bove, an attorney for Donald Trump, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/politics\/live-news\/trump-hush-money-trial-04-26-24\/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">continued questioning Pecker<\/a>, who claimed during his testimony that he purchased the rights to multiple unfavorable stories about Trump to ensure they never went to publication. Pecker's actions were referred to as a \"catch-and-kill\" scheme. <\/p><p>Pecker claimed that he had an arrangement with Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen to ensure the stories never saw the light of day. Also, during his testimony, he said he expected to be reimbursed directly by Trump or the Trump Organization for the scheme.<\/p><p>Pecker gave former Playboy playmate Karen McDougal $150,000 for her story. She claimed that she had had an extramarital affair with Trump. Pecker admitted that Trump never reimbursed him for his purchase of the story. Bove attempted to poke holes in Pecker's testimony, noting that the story would have been beneficial for the tabloid to run, and McDougal was trying to restart her career at the time she made the allegations. <\/p><p>Additionally, Pecker said he paid $30,000 for the exclusive rights to another story that turned out to be untrue, though he admitted he would have run the article if it had been accurate. He also did not receive any money from Trump for that story. <\/p><p>Despite previously being interested in McDougal's story, Pecker claimed that he \"didn't want anything to do\" with porn actress Stormy Daniels' story. She also claimed she had an affair with Trump.<\/p><p>\"I said to Michael Cohen that after paying for the doorman story and the Karen McDougal story, I wasn't going to pay anything further and I wasn't a bank,\" Pecker testified.<\/p><p>During his testimony earlier this week, Pecker claimed that Trump had thanked him for not running the unfavorable stories. However, Bove pointed out that in a 2018 interview with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Pecker did not state that Trump had expressed any gratitude toward him or the tabloid for such actions. <\/p><p>\"Are you suggesting the FBI made a mistake here?\" Bove asked Pecker.<\/p><p>Pecker acknowledged that the bureau's notes were inconsistent with his testimony.<\/p><p>\"I know what the truth is, I can't state why this is written this way. I know what was said to me,\" he responded. <\/p><p>Bove questioned whether Pecker still has equity in the National Enquirer's parent company, AMI. Pecker replied that he does.<\/p><p>\"Part of AMI's business model was to purchase stories, correct?\" Bove questioned. <\/p><p>Pecker confirmed that the company did regularly buy the rights to news stories and that the practice was not unique to Trump. The former publisher noted that there were other celebrities who were promoted by the tabloid and provided a warning when negative press was about to be published. Pecker previously said that he had a similar arrangement with Arnold Schwarzenegger.<\/p><p>He admitted that publishing negative stories about Trump dating back to the 1990s was \"not good for business.\" Pecker further acknowledged that he had never heard the term \"catch and kill\" prior to the case. Additionally, many of the negative articles about Trump's presidential opponents published by the National Enquirer were \"not exclusive\" to the tabloid, indicating that other media outlets had first reported the stories. <\/p><p>Rhona Graff, Trump's former executive assistant and former vice president of the Trump Organization, was briefly called to the stand as the prosecution's second witness.<\/p><p>Graff testified that she saw Stormy Daniels in the reception area at Trump Tower before Trump declared his presidential run.<\/p><p>During the defense's cross-examination, Graff told Trump's attorney, Susan Necheles, that Trump was a \"fair\" and \"respectful\" boss over her 34 years with the company.<\/p><p>\"Sometimes he would peek his head in and say, 'Go home to your family,' which I thought was very thoughtful of him,\" Graff stated.<\/p><p>She noted that she \"vaguely recall[ed]\" Trump saying that Daniels was at Trump Tower because she was considering being a contestant on \"Celebrity Apprentice.\"<\/p><p>The prosecution called its third witness to the stand, Gary Farro, a finance executive who worked at First Republic Bank for 15 years. Farro was employed at the bank when Cohen took out a home equity loan to cover the $130,000 payment to Daniels.<\/p><p>\"Michael Cohen was assigned to me after a colleague left in 2015,\" Farro stated, adding that he was \"very excited to be working for him.\"<\/p><p>Farro received an email on October 11, 2016, requesting that he contact Cohen. The email was shown to the jury, along with correspondence written a couple of days later by Farro, which read, \"Need an account opened for Mike Cohen immediately. He wants no address on the checks. Calling you now to discuss.\"<\/p><p>Farro said that Cohen wanted to open a new LLC, Resolution Consultants, claiming it was for \"capital real estate.\" He noted that it was not unusual for an LLC not to put an address on its checks.<\/p><p>\"A deposit was never made in the account, so the account never went live,\" Farro explained. He testified that he received an email roughly two weeks later that said Cohen no longer wanted to open Resolution Consultants but wanted to open a different LLC, Essential Consultants \u2014 the account Cohen allegedly used to pay Daniels.<\/p><p>The court will reconvene on Tuesday. Farro will return to the stand to conclude his direct examination and cross-examination.<\/p><h2>Anything else?<\/h2><p>At the start of Friday's trial, acting Justice Juan Merchan stated that the court would hold a hearing on Thursday regarding allegations that Trump had violated the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/judge-trumps-attorney-get-into-heated-exchange-over-gag-order-prosecutions-first-witness-returns-to-stand\" target=\"_blank\">judge's gag order<\/a>.<\/p><p>Merchan previously placed the order on Trump, preventing the former president from making any public statements about those involved in the trial or their family members.<\/p><p>Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and the prosecution accused Trump of violating that order approximately a dozen times, citing posts he wrote on social media as comments he made to the press outside the trial. Prosecutors asked the judge to hold Trump in contempt and order him to pay a $1,000 fine for each alleged violation. Bragg also requested that Merchan remind Trump that he could face jail time for repeatedly violating the order. <\/p><p><em><em>Like Blaze News?

He then asked what was the issue, and I simply stated I have a problem with Evil Queen being a man dressed in drag. The waiter immediately said he was going to get a manager, and he looked panicked,\" the father told That Park Place. \"At first, I said I wanted to formally complain about the Evil Queen being a man and that I felt very disrespected by Disney because this is not the sort of thing my family values and they didn\u2019t give us any type of notice that this sort of thing was even a possibility.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe irate father who had just blown roughly $60 per meal apparently made clear to the manager the trip had altogether costed him $8,000, not to mention his previous expenditures on Disney-branded adventures.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"At one point, the manager stated, 'I can assure you that she is a woman,'\" continued the father. \"She went even further, trying to shame me, informing me that 'she' was so excited to get the part as the Evil Queen. For a brief moment, I thought, 'Oh ... maybe I\u2019m wrong,' but then I realized that I was just being gaslighted.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhen the father asked whether the queen was a man, the manager allegedly responded, \"I'm sorry, sir, I cannot answer that.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tCampbell told Blaze News that \"if it weren't in a context where there were children present and it were something that was reasonably to be expected by guests of the Walt Disney Company \u2014 [a company] that has been so tied to traditional values for so long \u2014 then I think that there is a world in which that is acceptable in commerce.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe investigative reporter also noted that it is important to consider context and the type of costume when considering transvestism, as in the case of the hulking queen.\n<\/p><p>\n\tCampbell noted, for instance, that the Fantasmic fireworks show involves the Maleficent character pulling off some physical feats that might justify the use of a male performer. There's also the various masked characters, where the sex of the actor is immaterial \u2014 with the exception of the smaller, shorter characters, where size contra gender may be the determining factor in casting.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn the case of the Evil Queen at the Wilderness Lodge resort, the actor appears in videos to be bare-faced and playing a female role that Campbell suggested likely \"has a lot of competition.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tAccording to Campbell, it's uncommon and perhaps even a first to have a transvestite assuming an open-faced role in the Orlando parks, whereas in Disney's California parks, there have been multiple sightings of cross-dressing cast members.\n<\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1663381709667303425\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\">Disney has a man in a dress working in the dress store for little girls at Disneyland.

        "title": "Bare-knuckle champ Bobby Gunn: 'You gotta kill me to beat me'",
        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/bare-knuckle-champ-bobby-gunn-you-gotta-kill-me-to-beat-me.jpg?id=52108133&width=1245&height=700&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C314\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>\n\t\"She's <em>beautiful<\/em>, oh, she's beautiful! Mabel's beautiful. She's a baby, oh, she's a puppy!\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe way bare-knuckle boxing legend Bobby Gunn dotes on my 7-month-old French Bulldog\/Boston Terrier mix makes me regret we're not in the same room; I have a feeling they'd get along great. But even through the screen of my laptop, his genuine affection is clear.\n<\/p><p>\n\tI showed Gunn Mabel after finding out he has a French Bulldog of his own, a 12-year-old named Max who accompanies him everywhere. Gunn is just as enthusiastic when offering up this tidbit about Mabel's terrier side: \"Man, them dogs were bred for hunting rats, you know.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt's as if he can't resist recognizing a fellow fighter beneath the cuteness. According to writer Stayton Bonner, whose book <a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Bare-Knuckle-Bobby-Undefeated-Dream\/dp\/1982650710\" target=\"_blank\">\"Bare Knuckle: Bobby Gunn, 73-0 Undefeated. A Dad. A Dream. A Fight Like You've Never Seen\"<\/a> came out Tuesday, Gunn's gentle side is never far from the surface, even in the most forbidding environments.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"When I first met Bobby, I went to see him train at Ike and Randy's gym in Patterson, New Jersey,\" recalls Bonner. \"This was not an Equinox. You had to go through like a chain-link fence, past a couple of pit bulls. It was an old auto body shop. But he would bring this little dog with him, set him up with his little bowl, his food.\n<\/p><p>\"And I would talk to the other fighters there, who told me Bobby would tell [a fighter], 'When the ref's not looking, here's how to really take a man down.' Give him all these little tips. But then he would set him down afterwards and ask him if he'd accepted Jesus into his heart.\"<\/p><p>\n\tThis is apparent during the 40 minutes I talk with Gunn, who speaks quickly and has a thick Irish accent (he's an Irish Traveller who grew up in Canada). He addresses me as \"sir\" and makes frequent reference to God. More than once he chokes up as he marvels at how far he's come.\n<\/p><p>\n\tRaised in crushing poverty by his volatile father, who taught him to fight. The same father who had him squaring off against grown men in motel parking lots for money by the time he was eleven. Today's he settled down, retired from fighting, with a loving wife and a beautiful daughter, and dedicated to giving them the kind of life he never had.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnd now, with the help of former Rolling Stone editor Bonner, he's telling his life story, just as the underground sport he dominated makes its way to mainstream legitimacy \u2014 and potentially huge revenues.\n<\/p><p class=\"shortcode-media shortcode-media-rebelmouse-image\">\n        <img alt=\"\" class=\"rm-shortcode\" data-rm-shortcode-id=\"e6e5bc1593402261454d5b3fd21971a1\" data-rm-shortcode-name=\"rebelmouse-image\" id=\"3f85d\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/image.jpg?id=52108116&width=980\"\/>\n\t<small class=\"image-media media-photo-credit\" placeholder=\"Add Photo Credit...\">Blackstone<\/small>\n<\/p><p>\n\tGunn fought in the first legally sanctioned bare-knuckle match in 2018. Since then, the sport has grown into a $411 billion business.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAs we speak, Philadelphia-based <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bkfc.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Bare Knuckle Fighting Championship<\/a>, which bills itself as \"the first promotion allowed to hold a legal, sanctioned, and regulated bare knuckle event in the United States since 1889,\" is gearing up for its latest pay-per-view brawl, Knucklemania IV, which happens this Saturday in Los Angeles. Gunn will serve as one of the commentators.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhile Gunn's bare-knuckle career has seen him fighting in front of Russian mafiosi as well as biker gangs, he maintains it was more pleasant than his stint in mainstream pro boxing.<\/p><p>\n\t\"The underground world, sir, was better than the boxing world. The boxing world was way more corrupted. Corruption, oh, believe me, I had to fight referees and judges. It was enemies against you. The underground world was way more fair. A fair shake. That's the truth.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnd although the spectacle of men pummeling each other with their bare fists does have an undeniable shock value appeal,  Gunn points out that it's actually safer than boxing. For one thing, matches seldom go the distance; early knockouts are common.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAlso, when you wear a boxing glove, \"you've got a weapon on your hand,\" says Gunn. \"You punch hard as you can because your hand's protected. ... I don't hit as hard in bare knuckle, sir. I only hit 30%, 40% shots, way more lighter shots. I'll go with the body harder, because I don't want to break my hand.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tNot that he hasn't sustained some damage along the way. Gunn takes his hand and pushes his nose against his face; he turns so he's showing his profile. It's completely flat. \"Do you think I care about a little cut in my nose?\" he laughs.\n<\/p><p>\n\tGunn seems to be approaching this phase of his life with the same calm determination that brought him his 73-0 record. \"I fear no man, but I respect every man,\" Gunn tells me. \"When I go to fight, there's a light switch that goes right off. When that happens, you gotta kill me to beat me. That's all I am.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t<strong>Click <a href=\"https:\/\/roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms\/files\/61606\/HC%20ARC%20-%20Bare%20Knuckle%20by%20Stayton%20Bonner%204.23.24_extract.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">here for an excerpt<\/a> of \"Bare Knuckle\" courtesy of Blackstone Publishing.<\/strong>\n<\/p>",

        "title": "Regulating AI won't protect Americans; it's about Big Tech having a monopoly",
        "description": "\n<img src=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/media-library\/regulating-ai-won-t-protect-americans-it-s-about-big-tech-having-a-monopoly.jpg?id=52108405&width=1200&height=800&coordinates=0%2C346%2C0%2C50\"\/><br\/><br\/><p>The more I read and write about AI, the firmer I get in my conviction that Big Tech incumbents absolutely must strangle the decentralized AI in its cradle before it wrecks everything.<\/p><p>Take a look at <a href=\"https:\/\/stratechery.com\/2023\/new-bing-and-an-interview-with-kevin-scott-and-sam-altman-about-the-microsoft-openai-partnership\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>this interview<\/u><\/a> Ben Thompson did with OpenAI\u2019s Sam Altman and Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott. I call your attention to this part in particular:<\/p><blockquote>From Microsoft\u2019s perspective, is this going to be a funnel into new products or do you see it as an end goal in and of itself, winning search?<br\/>KS: So I think you hit on a very important point which is even if the ad economics of this system doesn\u2019t have the same economics that \u201cnormal search\u201d has, if we gain share, it\u2019s just great for Microsoft. I think we have a lot of ability here, partially because we\u2019ve done so much performance optimization work and we\u2019re really confident around costs, that we can figure out what the business model is. The thing that I know having been a pre-IPO employee at Google is the search business that you have now is very different from the search business that we had twenty years ago, and so I really think we\u2019re going to figure out what the ad units are, we will figure out what the business model is, and we have plenty of ability to do all of that profitably at Microsoft.<br\/>SA: There\u2019s so much value here, it\u2019s inconceivable to me that we can\u2019t <strong>figure out how to ring the cash register on it<\/strong>. [Emphasis added]<\/blockquote><p>I recently said the same thing to an interviewer who asked me about search and Google. The point I made was that Google was here before with search the first time \u2014 there was no business model for it until it hit on one (by acquisition, no less). Don\u2019t assume, I argued, that it won\u2019t hit on another profitable model for whatever kind of user experience BingGPT and Bard evolve into.<\/p><p>But I also made another point to the interviewer that\u2019s not at all captured in the above but that\u2019s critically important for everyone thinking about tech policy in the current moment: <em>to make any business model work for them, they will first have to kill decentralized AI.<\/em><\/p><h4>Centralized vs. decentralized<\/h4><p>There\u2019s a set of assumptions implicit in Scott and Altman\u2019s vision of how they might eventually \u201cring the cash register\u201d on AI-backed chat as the new query interface for most information:<\/p><ul><li>Users go to their centralized servers and type text into a box that they host.<\/li><li>Advertisers go to those same servers to get in front of all the users.<\/li><li>Somehow, the advertisers and the users can be connected to one another, with Microsoft acting as a middleman.<\/li><li>Or, maybe the users pay Microsoft directly for the queries via a subscription or micropayment scheme.<\/li><\/ul><p>In other words, Microsoft\u2019s ability to squeeze profits out of the experience of interacting with an LLM presumes that billions of users will continue to flock to a handful of centralized services to get their queries answered. This is a vision, then, predicated on a world of centralized AI.<\/p><p>But what if we end up in a world of <em>decentralized AI<\/em> instead? What if I can download an app that will answer current questions from all of Wikipedia and Reddit, in some cases going out to both of those sites and pulling in fresh data?<\/p><p>What if some of the data sources are my favorite news websites and forums, all of which have signed up to provide data to the app and which get a cut of whatever revenue it generates?<\/p><p>Or, what if multiple such apps are powered by open-source language models and kept fresh by access to current data sources via an API? I could certainly see the New York Times publishing such an app all by itself, with the ability to answer any question from its vast archives of past issues.<\/p><h4>Decentralized AI is a real threat<\/h4><p>To give some technical context for why the vision of app-based, decentralized AI I\u2019ve described above is quite possible, consider that the size of the models needed to do this might be on the order of a few gigabytes each. For instance, the Stable Diffusion model file that powers its image generation is from 2.5 to 4.5 GB, depending on the version, and it was trained on 240TB of image data. That\u2019s an astonishing level of compression.<\/p><p>So, it may be possible that the average size of the models that we need to answer, say, 75% of our random questions about the world is roughly 3GB or so \u2014 about the size of a large mobile game download. <\/p><p>If I can download models that can reliably answer questions about their training data, why do I need to visit a Microsoft- or Google-hosted website and type queries into their text boxes? If I want recipes from my favorite recipe site, maybe I visit their site instead and talk to <em><em>their<\/em><\/em> model. If I want the current NYT or WaPo consensus on Ukraine, why won\u2019t I just go to those sites and chat with <em><em>their<\/em><\/em> bots? Why does a Microsoft or a Google need to be involved in any of this?<\/p><p>The answer, of course, is that they don\u2019t need to be involved. Decentralized AI can and will cut them out entirely, <em><em>assuming it\u2019s allowed to<\/em><\/em>.<\/p><p>But that\u2019s a big assumption because the future of decentralized AI is by no means guaranteed.<\/p><p>But before we go into who\u2019s trying to kill decentralized AI and why, some caveats:<\/p><ol><li>Using the models to answer questions requires quite a bit of computing power. But these inference costs can and will be reduced with innovation, as this is an active area of research. Also, have you seen mobile phones, lately? There\u2019s no shortage of computing power, and phone makers are always looking for ways to use it. After a few product cycles of optimizing the hardware for running queries, it\u2019s not hard to imagine very fast local performance on many kinds of models.<\/li><li>Yes, the models still make up facts. This hallucination is a big problem, but it\u2019s also one that everyone is working on. The models will get better at faithfully representing the facts in their data sources.<\/li><\/ol><h4>We\u2019ll have to fight for a decentralized future<\/h4><p>I\u2019ve written at length on my Substack about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jonstokes.com\/p\/the-story-so-far-ai-makes-for-strange\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>forces arrayed against decentralized AI<\/u><\/a>, so I won\u2019t repeat that here. But to summarize: The aforementioned model files representing the \u201cbrains\u201d of an AI like Stable Diffusion or ChatGPT could very easily be treated like digital contraband and wiped from the internet.<\/p><p>Everyone from Googlers to Google-hating former Googlers to indie artists to profiteering lawyers are hard at work constructing rationales for why these model files should be subject to the same censorship as child porn, 3D-printed gun files, pirated movies, SPAM, and malware. <\/p><p>Here are some of the rationales currently being explored for banning decentralized AI:<\/p><ul><li>All the model files are full of copyright violations because they were trained on copyrighted data.<\/li><li>Generative text models can cause harm to the marginalized because \u201chate speech\u201d can be coaxed out of them.<\/li><li>Generative text models will catastrophically increase the threat of \u201cdisinformation.\u201d <\/li><li>Generative image models will be used for non-consensual fake porn of real people, many of them children.<\/li><\/ul><p>We wouldn\u2019t even have to pass any new laws to have these model files banned. All it would take was an agreement among a handful of large players that these files and any apps or sites based on them pose a threat. I imagine the following platforms can and probably will come together to effect what amounts to an effective ban on decentralized AI:<\/p><ul><li>Google Play<\/li><li>Apple\u2019s App Stores<\/li><li>Amazon Web Services<\/li><li>Cloudflare<\/li><\/ul><p>This means a world where everyone gets to host their own models backed by their own data sources, and facts are by no means guaranteed. Going by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.jonstokes.com\/p\/politics-broke-the-internet-and-it\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><u>the lessons of history<\/u><\/a>, I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably unlikely.<\/p><p>It seems increasingly likely to me that the forces of centralization will succeed in getting unauthorized model files treated like contraband, and in five years, we\u2019ll still be running all of our queries on servers hosted by one of the Big Tech platforms.<\/p><p>I hope I\u2019m wrong about this, but I do know that if we\u2019re going to have decentralized AI, then we\u2019re going to have to fight for it.<\/p>",

The same rule would apply to girls who \u201cidentify\u201d as boys. The president has effectively made every team and league for girls and women coed. <\/p><p>Someone should remind the \u201cparty of science\u201d that testosterone is not a social construct. On average, men are larger, stronger, and faster than women. Those physical differences are magnified in the world of elite athletic competition. <\/p><p>In 2017, the WNBA released a video with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=o5xInpA--LM&t=3s\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">every<\/a> dunk in the league\u2019s history. It lasted a little over one minute. That\u2019s about the length of 5-foot-7 Spud Webb\u2019s highlight <a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=r1YRJvFvlgg\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">video<\/a> from the 1986 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. <\/p><p>Florence Griffith Joyner set the women\u2019s 100-meter dash record (10.49 seconds) at the 1988 Summer Olympics. No woman has topped it in 36 years. But her time doesn\u2019t even rank among the <em>top 7,000<\/em> for men. In fact, several high school boys have beaten it. <\/p><p>These facts are not meant to diminish female athletes. There is a long list of women in every sport from tennis to gymnastics whose names will be mentioned among the all-time greats. But progressives need to be reminded that feelings don\u2019t compete in athletics, bodies do. <\/p><p>The law is a teacher. The lesson this administration wants American girls to learn is that they are second-class citizens whose safety, security, and comfort are subordinate to the feelings of men. This shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise to anyone who understands that in the world of politics, personnel is policy. <\/p><p>This is why Joe Biden\u2019s appointment of Dr. Rachel Levine as assistant secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services was so significant. Levine is a man who formerly went by the name \u201cRichard\u201d and had two children with his ex-wife before identifying as a woman in 2011. It is unlikely that Levine would have been appointed to one of the most important positions in America\u2019s public health establishment if he thought he was King Tut and dressed like a pharaoh. But in America today, some mental disorders are promoted through public policy while others are not.<\/p><p>The president and his administration just proved that all their talk about women\u2019s rights is empty rhetoric meant to pacify his female voters. The same can be said for feminist organizations and women in politics, athletics, and media who speak out on every other social issue. The National Organization for Women displayed feminism\u2019s <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonexaminer.com\/opinion\/beltway-confidential\/2956000\/national-organization-for-women-deletes-social-media-post-about-white-supremacist-patriarchy\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">powerlessness<\/a> in the face of the \u201ctheytriarchy\u201d in a since-deleted social media post: <\/p><blockquote>\"Repeat after us: Weaponizing womenhood [sic] against other women is white supremacist patriarchy at work,\u201d the since-deleted post said. \u201cMaking people believe there isn\u2019t enough space for trans women in sports is white supremacist patriarchy at work.\"<\/blockquote><p>This thinking is why women like Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris, Jemele Hill, and Mina Kimes will not utter a word in defense of the sisterhood. When you\u2019ve spent a lifetime claiming to be oppressed because of your sex, the last thing you can afford to do is be seen as an \u201coppressor\u201d by the people claiming victim status because of their gender identity. <\/p><p>Democrats claim to stand up for women one minute, then betray them for delusional men the next. In the progressive game of intersectional poker, an \u201cimpossible\u201d woman beats a natural one every time. It\u2019s taken more than 60 years, but it seems like feminists have finally found a group of men who can make them sit down and be quiet. <\/p>",

It included billionaire Mark Zuckerberg and more than <em>$350 million<\/em> of his own money.<\/p><p>Private dollars were given to public election offices through left-wing nonprofit organizations \u2014 but with a few conditions. It amounted to a Democratic get-out-the-vote effort, which included mass mail-in voting and ballot \u201ccuring,\u201d whereby election workers fix mail-in ballot problems after the ballot has been submitted.<\/p><p>And the money wasn\u2019t thrown around willy-nilly. It was directed toward government election offices in the biggest cities in swing states, where a majority of the Democratic Party\u2019s voters live. Those funds were used for Democrats\u2019 voter outreach, designing and translating ballots, along with ballot harvesting, curing, and counting operations.<\/p><p>The conflict of interest here is obvious. Partisan and private funding, going to partisan Democrat organizations, then funneled to <em>public<\/em> election offices to target Democrat voters, was being done in the most unprecedented election in modern history.<\/p><p>This was all part of the system that emerged after 2020. I\u2019m not arguing about the eventual election results, but this new system doesn\u2019t breed a great deal of voter confidence.<\/p><p>More than half the country has now <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncsl.org\/elections-and-campaigns\/prohibiting-private-funding-of-elections\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">banned private funding<\/a> in our elections. If your state isn\u2019t among that group, why not? Why does it need private funding? Why doesn't it care that those funds might have strings attached like in 2020?<\/p><p>All of this was justified because of the pandemic. They don\u2019t have that anymore. But never to fear. Three years ago, Joe Biden issued an executive order titled, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.federalregister.gov\/documents\/2021\/03\/10\/2021-05087\/promoting-access-to-voting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Promoting Access to Voting<\/a>.\u201d<\/p><p>Its stated goal was to \u201cpromote and defend the right to vote,\u201d and Biden directed every agency in government to participate.<\/p><p>Federal agencies were somehow supposed to look into voter registration, expand vote-by-mail, and use <em>approved<\/em> third-party organizations to help them get it all done. We all saw what approved third-party organizations meant in 2020. It meant partisan politics with strings attached. In short, Biden refused to let us know just what this executive order was meant to do.<\/p><p>In the weeks leading up to the midterms, Biden\u2019s Justice Department <a href=\"https:\/\/www.foxnews.com\/politics\/doj-stonewalling-requests-details-implementation-bidens-federal-election-scheme\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">stonewalled Freedom of Information Act requests<\/a>. Was Joe Biden picking up where Mark Zuckerberg left off? Leaders refused to tell us, but the Foundation for Government Accountability called Biden\u2019s executive order an \u201cunconstitutional taxpayer-funded \u2018get out the vote\u2019 effort designed to benefit the president\u2019s political party.\u201d<\/p><p>So, it\u2019s essentially \u201cZuck Bucks\u201d on government-funded steroids, and new information appears to prove this. <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OversightPR\/status\/1759766360182161836\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">This email<\/a> was revealed by the Heritage Foundation\u2019s Oversight Project. It\u2019s a collaboration between an apparent approved third-party and the Department of Agriculture. The subject line states that this collaboration is regarding Biden\u2019s secret squirrel voting rights executive order. This line jumps out:<\/p><blockquote>Y'all had asked for some data on voter registration through NVRA [National Voter Registration Act] at the state level, which I\u2019ve pasted below. So the Department of Agriculture \u2014 of all agencies \u2014 had enlisted the support of this approved third-party to get their info at <em>state<\/em> level on voter registration data.<\/blockquote><p>Who is this third party helping the government? It\u2019s a nonprofit called D\u0113mos. Here is part of its <a href=\"https:\/\/www.demos.org\/about\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mission statement<\/a>:<\/p><blockquote>Working to build a just, inclusive, multiracial democracy ... D\u0113mos has worked at the intersection of democracy reform, economic justice, and racial justice ... D\u0113mos has moved progressive issues from the movement to the mainstream, such as debt-free college.<\/blockquote><p>That doesn\u2019t sound very nonpartisan, does it? In fact, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.influencewatch.org\/non-profit\/demos\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">D\u0113mos has<\/a> \u201cclose ties to the wing of the Democratic Party associated with U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren and the left-wing progressive movement, advocating a far-left agenda.\u201d And now it's working directly with the U.S. government on our elections.<\/p><p>I\u2019ve been exposing the big progressive financing to fundamentally transform our country for a long time. But who really needs the Tides Foundation, Mark Zuckerberg, or even George Soros anymore? The U.S. government is now taking their place, and Uncle Sam\u2019s pockets are a bit deeper than all of them combined.<\/p><p>In this system, the unprecedented changes to the way we vote \u2014 expanded early and absentee voting, mass mail-in ballots, ballot harvesting \u2014 will become the norm. But why are leftists so laser focused on mail-in and early voting? Because for them and their media surrogates, all they\u2019re doing is making voting easier. <em>Bull crap<\/em>. They\u2019ve done the studies, and they know exactly what they are doing.<\/p><p><em>Want more from Glenn Beck?

Kennedy Jr., or some other candidate. It then asked respondents a series of questions about illegal voting behaviors. Many of the questions were written specifically to gauge voters\u2019 willingness to undermine the candidate they view as their primary opponent.\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\n\tIf voters are willing to cheat, lawmakers must enact policies to stop them.\n<\/p><p>\n\tFor example, one question asked, \u201cIf given the opportunity, would you cast a ballot in two different states to help stop [Joe Biden \/ Donald Trump] from being re-elected as president?\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnother asked, \u201cIf given the opportunity, would you throw out or destroy a mail-in ballot belonging to a friend or family member, without their knowledge, to help stop [Joe Biden \/ Donald Trump] from being re-elected as president?\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tQuestions also asked voters whether they would fill out and sign the ballot of a friend or family member, give another voter incorrect information about the place or time of the election, secretly alter another voter\u2019s mail-in ballot, or offer to \u201cpay or reward another voter\u201d to influence his or her decision. All these actions violate federal and state election laws.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe results of the survey are nothing short of stunning: 28% of voters said they would be willing to engage in at least one form of illegal voting. If that\u2019s an accurate reflection of the entire voting population, it would amount to more than 44 million voters, based on 2020 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fec.gov\/resources\/cms-content\/documents\/2020presgeresults.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">voter turnout data<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\n\tPerhaps most surprisingly, there was very little difference between voters\u2019 political affiliations and their willingness to cheat: 32% of Democrat respondents said they would be willing to cheat, compared to 28% of Republicans and 24% of \u201cother\u201d voters.\n<\/p><p>\n\tTrump voters (29%) were slightly more likely than Biden voters (27%) to say they would break election rules, clearly indicating that there is a willingness to cheat on both sides.\n<\/p><p>\n\tOne demographic characteristic that stood out was the age of the respondent in the survey. More than half of voters ages 18-39 said they would be willing to break election rules, compared to just 20% of those ages 40-64 and 15% of voters ages 65 or older.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe Heartland-Rasmussen survey further illustrates how wildly polarized America has become, but it also raises key concerns about the security of U.S. elections.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMost of the questions in the survey asked about behavior related to mail-in balloting, which has become significantly more common since the outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAccording to a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ncsl.org\/elections-and-campaigns\/table-1-states-with-no-excuse-absentee-voting\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">study<\/a> by the National Conference of State Legislatures, 28 states allow \u201cno-excuse\u201d mail-in balloting, which means voters don\u2019t need to have a special reason to vote by mail, such as a physical disability.\n<\/p><p>\n\tAnother eight states conduct their elections primarily by mail: California, Colorado, Hawaii, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Vermont, and Washington.\n<\/p><p>\n\tMore importantly, every one of the most important 2024 swing states \u2014 Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin \u2014 allows no-excuse mail-in voting or has a vote-by-mail system.\n<\/p><p>\n\tSome states say that they protect against absentee ballot fraud by requiring signature verification. But the Heartland-Rasmussen survey shows that voters are willing to cheat in ways that wouldn\u2019t be caught by signature verification.\n<\/p><p>\n\tFor example, the survey asked, \u201cIf your spouse or another trusted family member gave you permission to fill out and sign their mail-in ballot, allowing you to use their ballot to vote for anyone that you choose, would you?\u201d Eighteen percent of respondents answered \u201cyes.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tUnder such a scenario, a person might be able to replicate the signature of a spouse well enough that it wouldn\u2019t be caught by election officials. However, even if officials were to flag the signature as suspicious, in many cases, states ask the voter before tossing out a ballot. Unless a voter is willing to admit his or her spouse broke election laws, there would be no way for officials to know that the ballot was filled out illegally.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThere are two solutions to these concerns. First, states could require that able-bodied, in-state residents vote in person, not by mail.\n<\/p><p>\n\tSecond, states could require that mail-in voters have their signatures verified by a notary. Notaries are readily available, often for free, at banks and other institutions. Many government buildings have one or more notaries as well.\n<\/p><p>\n\tCurrently, only <a href=\"https:\/\/www.usvotefoundation.org\/absentee-ballot-notary-witness-requirements\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">three states<\/a> \u2014 Mississippi, Missouri, and Oklahoma \u2014 require a notary for absentee ballots.\n<\/p><p>\n Free and fair elections are the bedrock of a democratic republic. If voters are willing to cheat, as the recent Heartland-Rasmussen survey shows, lawmakers must enact policies to stop them. Unfortunately, that has yet to happen.<\/p>",

Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) joined me on <a href=\"https:\/\/podcasts.apple.com\/us\/podcast\/the-saturday-massacre-of-the-house-gop-and\/id1065050908?i=1000653236003\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">my show<\/a> earlier this week for a lively chat about House Speaker Mike Johnson\u2019s three disastrous betrayals to the Republican Party and why he needs to resign. Here is an edited transcript of our discussion.<\/p><p>Thomas Massie: Let\u2019s talk about the three big betrayals that we\u2019ve seen in the last few weeks. The first was the omnibus. It was bigger than any omnibus that Nancy Pelosi passed. It got a majority of Democrats and got only a minority of Republicans on the roll call. It didn't fund the border. It was atrocious. Yet, it sailed through, and Mike Johnson pushed it through. That's the first betrayal.<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">You cannot let a man like Mike Johnson, who has betrayed us three times in a row in just a few weeks, stay in power.<\/p><p>Let\u2019s go to the second betrayal, where, again, people say, \"Mike's got such a slim majority. It\u2019s too hard to get anything. We just had to take what we could get.\" That story doesn't work on FISA because FISA was going to get reauthorized. \u2026 We had reformed it. We had a warrant provision. If you want to put Americans' names into the database and search through their private records that you've collected, you should have to get a warrant. The stars were lined up, and Mike Johnson supported the warrant provision until he became speaker.<\/p><p>People will argue that Johnson wasn't the tiebreaker and the deciding vote, but I will argue that he was, and I'll tell you why: The speaker doesn't often vote on bills or amendments. In fact, he didn't vote on the other amendments that were on the floor for FISA that day. He went out of his way to do something that he doesn\u2019t frequently do. He voted on an amendment, and he voted against a Republican amendment. The vote ended up being 212-212.<\/p><p>I took a picture of the tie vote and noted that he\u2019s the one who broke the tie.<\/p><p>A majority of Republicans voted for the warrant requirement, and a majority of Democrats voted with Mike Johnson against the warrant requirement. That\u2019s how we ended up with a tie vote, and it failed. Don\u2019t tell me, \u201cOh, poor Mike Johnson. He's such a religious conservative man, and he\u2019s got such a slim majority. It's hard to get anything done.\u201d That\u2019s his excuse, because ideologically, he was for the warrant requirement before he became speaker. It wasn\u2019t some slim majority that kept us from getting the FISA warrant requirement. It was Mike Johnson himself.<\/p><p>Daniel Horowitz: So, now, it\u2019s a values issue.<\/p><p>Massie: Yes, his values are against the majority of the conference.<\/p><p>So, now on to the third betrayal, which just happened. They spent $100 billion on the foreign aid package. The foreign aid supplemental started out as HR 815 in the House of Representatives, and it passed with unanimous support because it expanded eligibility for veterans to get reimbursement for emergency care. \u2026 It went to the Senate, and the Senate stripped every word out of it and put their foreign aid supplemental into it. The irony is, they're bringing us to the brink of war in places around the globe by the vehicle they\u2019re using that started out as a veterans' benefits bill.<\/p><p>Now, here's what happened Saturday that most of my colleagues didn\u2019t realize. My staff told me, \u201cBoss, we think you\u2019re not going to believe this. We think Mike Johnson is actually in the room. He\u2019s going to take up the Senate bill. He\u2019s trying to say he's doing a different set of four bills and sending them to the Senate, but he\u2019s actually just taking up the Senate bill.\u201d<\/p><p>That\u2019s what we did. We pretended to vote on four separate bills that were going to go to the Senate. But the rules committee I serve on voted against this rule because I saw what was going on. They said that as soon as these four bills pass, we\u2019re going to deem them as amendments to the Senate bill that they sent us.<\/p><p>Other members were like, \u201cMr. Speaker, please don't make us go back to our constituents and tell them that we just sent $100 billion overseas and did nothing on the border.\u201d<\/p><p>Mike Johnson wanted Ukraine as fervently as the left, but a majority of Republicans did not want Ukraine. He\u2019s kind of the cause and the symptom at the same time. But he\u2019s at the center of this problem. We're doing nothing to show our constituents that we really are working for them.<\/p><p>Horowitz: So, looking forward, you cosigned the motion to vacate.<\/p><p>Massie: I think there is value in exposing the uni-party. I hope people can see it now, and they can see that Mike Johnson is part of it. But there\u2019s no better way than to force the vote to vacate the chair and see where folks line up.<\/p><p>We\u2019re trying to convince the speaker to resign, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re cosponsoring the motion to vacate. If five or six people would additionally cosponsor the motion to vacate, then it\u2019s obvious that Johnson doesn\u2019t have the votes without Democrats. The honorable thing for him to do would be to resign.<\/p>That\u2019s if Johnson cared about this country, if he cared about our conference. I'm convinced he doesn't at this point. But if he did, he would do the honorable thing. He's got to taste the power. He can\u2019t let go, even though he\u2019s incompetent at the job. You know, he's gone into every negotiation and given Democrats what they want with extra special features. He\u2019s gotten nothing for conservatives. You cannot let a man like Mike Johnson, who has betrayed us three times in a row in the course of just a few weeks, stay in power.",

Should you hop on board the EV bandwagon?

We've been down this road before<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tPaul: Electric cars are not new. When the 1901 Chicago Auto Show was staged, more than half of the fourteen vehicles that were shown at that show were electric vehicles. It's not a new idea at all. The problem is, is that there's this nasty little thing called practicality.\n<\/p>\n<p class=\"pull-quote\">\n\tIt's all smoke and mirrors. This is all about control. Don't let anyone kid you that this electric car thing isn't about limiting your range.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThere are a lot of people who are saying, \"I've seen all of this, I apparently should be doing it.\" And then they get hit with the harsh realities of what happens with an electric vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<h2>2. They're more expensive than you think<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tLauren: If you're thinking about buying an electric car ... you have to look at the full costs. The first thing you're gonna do is [ask], \"What's the payment? Oh, ok, I think I can afford that, especially with all these incentives.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[But these incentives] are now only for 12 cars, that's it. Because they kept changing their regulations and they're gonna make them even stricter. Right now we have 12 cars that qualify, and not all the Teslas even qualify, only the high-performance versions do.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnd many of the states are out of the matching credits. ... [They] have either stopped or have no more money left in their funds to have matching credits to support this incentive.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe insurance is twice as much or close to twice as much [as] a regular gasoline-powered car.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe tires wear out quicker because these are heavier, they're low-rolling resistant and run-flat tires. They're not $100 a tire, they're $400 a tire, and they wear out about every 10,000 miles. Of course, no one talks about that ... but it's important that you look at all the true cost of owning a vehicle.\n\t<span><\/span>\n<\/p>\n<h2>3. They depreciate faster than a Model S Plaid in Drag Strip mode<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tLauren: Look at that really cool Porsche Taycan \u2014 I think it's spectacular. Unfortunately, [it's a] $200,000 car [that's] available used for $100,000. So, if you buy one of these vehicles, you're losing about half as soon as you drive off the lot.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t If you are considering an electric vehicle, a lease would be your smartest move.  Walk away at the end of your two- or three-year period.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: Do not buy an electric vehicle. Period.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span><\/span>Lauren: The battery replacement will make you cry. Some of them are as much as $60,000 for a new battery. Lease it, give it back to the dealer. That's your smartest move.\n<\/p>\n<h2>4. The charging infrastructure just isn't there yet<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tPaul: I just took a trip up to Road America [race track] last weekend. I live in the Chicago suburbs, and I happen to have a Kia EV9. That's what I was driving last week.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: Cool car, by the way. Very, very cool. Expensive, but very cool.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: I had to charge up on Friday night to make sure that I was topped off, and then I drove to Milwaukee, and I did some interviews at the Milwaukee Mile. Then I said, \"Hey, you know what, I can't find a level-3 charging station in Elkhart Lake.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t[A level-3 charger] you can read a comic book while you're charging; the other ones you better have a copy of a Leo Tolstoy novel with you.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, I had to drive from Milwaukee to Sheboygan, Wisconsin, to find a level-3 charger. Well, that's 35 miles, 40 miles away from where I was going \u2014 Road America. So, then I had another two hours while I was charging that vehicle.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t Lauren: Who's got two hours? Isn't time money? It is to me.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: When I finally got home, I had 19 miles of range [left]. It was terrifying because I'm watching that gauge closer than I'm watching the road.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: [Ask yourself], is there charging available around you? Now, we were just in California driving one of the newest Honda electric cars, and they said, \"Oh, there's four superchargers in this northern California town.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, we went there, and three of them weren't working. One of them was, but there was a Tesla there. If it takes 20 minutes to charge, you should kind of hang around.  Nope: 20 minutes later [it was clear] someone had plugged it in and taken off.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThe fact is that you're relying on public charging, but you have to still pay for that. And there's a cost to it. And electricity in California especially is the most expensive in the country. And I live in New York, and Paul lives in Illinois, also extremely expensive. So the three of us live in states where it's just crazy expensive for electricity, and it's not going down. Look at your electric bill every month. Now, add in a charging station.\n<\/p>\n<h2>5. Charging may pose hidden health risks<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tLauren: They always say, \"Oh, just sit in your car. It's fine. We have fully reclining seats and big screens and you can play video games,\" and it all sounds great on the surface.\n\t<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe've all heard, don't put your phone in your ear, right? Don't put your phone in your ear. Even these AirPods, if you put in two, it's causing all kinds of issues. Don't put your phone in your pocket, especially for guys. We've all heard and read about this in a million different places.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBut it's okay to sit in a car with alternating current.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, I actually have one of these gauges that I bring with me. The manufacturers hate when I bring it, so I have to keep it hidden.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: Did you get a tin foil hat?\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: [laughs] If you're sitting in the car while it's charging, you're not just exposing yourself but anyone in the car. So, it's like being in a microwave. It's alternating current, which is the problem.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tActually, you were with me, Paul. We were at one of the vehicle [test] drives at the super fast charger [that] takes 20 minutes. So, I asked the guy, and he said off the record, \"Get out of the car and go as far away as you can.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnd I said, \"Really?\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tHe said,  \"We're not going to tell anyone this because I'll lose my job. But get in the car, and park the car, plug it in, and go. Just go get something to eat and walk away.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBut they're telling us all in the mainstream, \"Oh, you can sit in the car with your kid and your dog and you can play games and make it fun.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNo one has addressed the medical side of this. And I fear that at some point, like much of the stuff the government sometimes pushes, [we'll find out it has health risks]. And I'm not wearing a tinfoil hat, you can talk to anyone.\n<\/p>\n<h2>6. The capacity just isn't there yet<br\/>\n<\/h2>\n<div>\n\tPaul: And it's not only the infrastructure, but it's the capacity. I know about a company that \u2014 because they had bought into the hype so heavily \u2014 wanted to change their trucks to EVs. And it was, I think, a fleet of about 20 or 25 trucks that they had.\n<\/div>\n<p>\n\tAnd they went to the village board and the village board said, \"Wait a minute. We're talking about you guys building this whole charging farm, and the amount of juice that you're requesting far exceeds the capacity of the entire village.\" And it wasn't a small village.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWe don't have the capacity. We don't have coal plants. We don't have enough new plants to do it.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: They want to shut those [coal plants] down.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: And it's just antithetical to what they're pitching. It's like nobody thought about this. They just said, \"This is a new idea, this is good, we're saving Mother Earth. We've got John Kerry, we've got Al Gore, we've got St. Greta ...\"\n\t<br\/>\n<\/p>\n<h2>7. They're bad for the environment ... and the roads<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tPaul: When Lauren said the tires are more expensive, there's a secondary problem with the tires as well. And that's particulate pollution.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: It's bad. It's worse. It kills the air. There's less CO2, but you're breathing in particles of tire.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: [Because an EV] could be 1,500, 2,000 pounds heavier [than a gas powered car]. And so now you've got a whole lot more weight that's playing on those tires.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: I have a lot of friends who are first responders and they say the biggest thing is when [an EV] catches fire for whatever reason, the problem is that it's a chemical reaction. It's polluting the environment worse than you can imagine.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t Not just digging up the raw materials to make the batteries, but if [a battery] catches fire, there's no way to recycle it. It's a nice idea, but the fact is, it'd be like me handing you a birthday cake and saying,  \"Could you take the eggs out?\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI just read an article that older cars from the '60s and '70s are better for the environment than the new cars because of the impact from what we call in our business \"cradle to grave.\" In other words, from all its raw materials all the way to the finished product and then the end-of-life cycle.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span><\/span>Paul: And secondarily, for a long time states have been very generous with licensing fees for electric vehicles. [Now] they're waking up, and they're saying, \"Well, wait a minute, how come that our pothole problems, our repaving problems, all of those things, are costing us more than they ever did before?\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: Especially on local roads, not necessarily highways. Highways are designed for 18-wheelers.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span><\/span>Paul: The taxpayer is paying that.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: The state of Texas is charging $400 when you register your car and $200 for every year after that. Every state is starting to charge by the mile.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you're thinking, \"Well, I don't have to pay gas taxes\" ... well, if you're not paying gas taxes, then who's going to repair the roads and bridges? That comes out of the general fund. And that's what a lot of states have done, including here in New York.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThey gotta come up with the money from some other places to pay for the electricity, to pay for the tax credits on a federal and a state level, and that's you who's paying for that. So, whether you think you're getting it for free, you're actually paying for it. Nothing is free.\n<\/p>\n<h2>8. They're about government control<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tLauren: It's all smoke and mirrors. This is all about control. Don't let anyone kid you that this electric car thing isn't about limiting your range.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: [They're working on technology that] if you're not making your payments, the auto drive system will drive it back to the dealership, so that it will in fact repossess your vehicle for you.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: Without a person.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: Yeah.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: So, you come out, and you're like, \"Where's my truck?\" It's at the dealer because you didn't make your payments.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\t<span><\/span> They've been able to lock you out of your car for a long time, especially on used car lots. But if you look at the infrastructure bill from 2021, the one that apparently Attorney General Ken Paxton has found to be illegal because they passed it without people actually being in Congress, there is a kill switch [proposal]. It will monitor everything in your car.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThey put this under the guise of [stopping] drunk driving. They want to put in a fingertip device [on the start button]. So, you took a medication, you've had a stressful day. I don't know, maybe you were using rubbing alcohol to remove nail polish. You touch that [and the car will decide] whether you should start [it] or not.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tThere's a company called Gentex. You want to look it up. It tracks from the rearview mirror. Your eyes and [the eyes of] every person in the car. Second row, third row, your dog, your kid, everyone, your facial movements, what's going on.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf it feels you're stressed, you're not paying attention, that's going to be added into the AI in the computer in front of you.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tIf you don't know if you have it, take your phone, just stand in front and take a picture [of your rear view mirror]. You'll see two red dots or blue or green. It's tracking your eyes. You've seen that. \"Please pay attention to the road. Do you need a coffee?\"\n<\/p>\n<h2>9. Nobody wants them<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tPaul: If you need some sort of an impartial barometer as to what's been going on, take a look at what's been happening at the car rental companies, where the car rental companies have just been having a horrible, horrible time renting the EVs that they already had.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: Nobody wants them. \n\t<br\/>\n\t<br\/>\n\tPaul: Yeah, nobody wants them. They've sold off half of their inventory. And, and gee, what did they find out when they went to sell their existing fleet? Well, they're not really worth what they were worth. You know, what they thought they were.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: They're taking a huge hit. Remember, there was a shortage of cars because of the chip shortage. So.\n\t<br\/>\n\tElon Musk, smart guy that he is, he's the marketing king. He went to the car rental company and said, \"Hey listen, I've got cars, I can't sell them. Let's work a deal, I'll cut you a deal, you can offer electric cars, everybody's happy, the government's happy, you look like you're helping in the agenda, everybody's happy.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tWell, people don't want them. I've talked to quite a few people, including myself, where I've gone to Hertz and they said, \"Hey, we don't have that car that you wanted, that SUV, but we do have a Tesla.\" They're so excited to tell you, and I'm like, \"No, that's not gonna work.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, are people accepting it? He goes, \"No, we can't, we can't not rent them.\" You have to return them fully charged. That takes time. When you're at a destination, whether it's a vacation or a business meeting, you have a very tight schedule. You go, you do what you need to do. You want to drop the car and take off at the airport. I get the field purchase option. If you look at the charging, you can't bring it in on fumes. And they've also found there's a high maintenance on tires, because like I said, tires wear out quicker, but also there's a lot of damage to these cars and the cost to repair the damage like any rental car.\n<\/p>\n<h2>10. They're bad for America<\/h2>\n<p>\n\tLauren: We have more fossil fuels here, or oil, underneath the ground than any other country. But instead, we're buying it from Russia and the Middle East. And we're getting all of our battery materials from China.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, while you think it's being environmentally friendly, all you're doing is helping China and the Middle East and Russia make more money. Now, wherever you think about that politically has nothing to do with it. The fact is, we can be energy efficient, and we were. But this administration wants to be reliable on other countries.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnd China, of course, would love to take over our country by bringing in Chinese cars and owning everything that we have and making us basically sit at home and play video games all day.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tPaul: We're trying to limit the amount of Chinese product that we're bringing into the States. But if the Chinese build their plants in Mexico, well, then all of a sudden, there's a trade agreement that we have with Mexico and with Canada, that allows those same vehicles to be accessed by Americans.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tLauren: You know what's interesting, Paul, is if you look at China, why they're telling us, \"Oh, electric,\" because they knew they couldn't take over the U.S. car industry. They knew they couldn't beat the Germans. So they came up with this electric story and pushed the story, helped politicians get reelected by helping them push the narrative.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tNow, there are five Chinese car manufacturers building plants in Mexico as we speak. At the same time, they're building nuclear power plants and coal-fired plants in China. We're taking those down where they're building seven a week.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tSo, they've got plenty of energy ... and of course they're building stuff quick because that's how they do everything. They're gonna build plants in Mexico already started, they're gonna be fully automated.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tI'm on the World Car of the Year. We've driven the Suzuki, the SAIC, BYD, all of them. As a matter of fact, I'm supposed to go to China to see the plants, which I'm finding very interesting. But the fact is they want to bring these cars in here. And what does that mean? Everyone's like, \"Oh, great, low-cost cars.\"\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tBe careful what you wish for, because the big three automakers that are here in the U.S. and all the manufacturers that are building here, Honda, Toyota, all of these plants are going to lose jobs.\n<\/p>\n<p>\n\tAnd that affects not just the Dow, and the stock market, it affects jobs, it affects the economy. And believe it or not, the auto industry and all the little companies that support it is so big it's half of the Dow Jones, and people don't even realize that.\n\t<span><\/span>\n<\/p>",

After the Nazi forces were routed in Europe and the war at large was coming to an end, Edl, not yet 10 years old, was tossed into one of communist dictator Josip \"Tito\" Broz's concentration camps in Yugoslavia along with thousands of other Danube Schwabians who had been collectively branded as Nazi collaborators by Tito's communist Partisans and targeted for their German ethnic backgrounds.\n<\/p><p>\n\tEdl \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.wjbf.com\/news\/special-reports\/special-report-a-story-of-survival\/\" target=\"_blank\">told<\/a> WJBF-TV, \"We were considered to be non-human. It was just permission for torture and killing by the government.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tIn camp <a href=\"https:\/\/www.chicagotribune.com\/1992\/12\/01\/gakova-survivors\/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Gakowa<\/a>, Edl indicated she ended up losing all of the skin on her legs and was hobbled by sores. \"People gagged when they came near me,\" she said. \"The flies and the fleas and the lice, and the bed bugs just loved this festering body.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tEdl and her remaining family members ultimately managed to escape into Austria. After spending several years in refugee camps, they made it to the United States where she now might die in prison for defending the lives of the biggest cohort of dehumanized people, \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.who.int\/news-room\/fact-sheets\/detail\/abortion\" target=\"_blank\">slaughtered by the tens of millions globally every year<\/a>.\n<\/p><p>\n\tThe Biden Department of Justice \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-mdtn\/pr\/four-defendants-found-guilty-federal-charges-after-obstructing-patients-and-providers\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">charged<\/a> Eva Edl, 88, and 10 other pro-life activists in October 2022 for violating the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act \u2014 a law ratified in 1994 by former President Bill Clinton. The pro-life activists had <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/news\/tennessee-pro-life-activists-arrested-charged-doj-abortion\" target=\"_blank\">staged a peaceful protest<\/a> inside the Carafem abortion clinic in Mount Juliet, Tennessee, on March 5, 2021, singing and praying in support of those persons who had and would be slain deeper inside the abattoir.\n<\/p><blockquote class=\"rm-embed twitter-tweet\" data-partner=\"rebelmouse\" data-twitter-tweet-id=\"1775322296493707333\">\n        <div style=\"margin:1em 0\"><\/div> \u2014  (@)\n        <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/greg_price11\/status\/1775322296493707333\"><\/a>\n    <\/blockquote>\n        <script async=\"\" charset=\"utf-8\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\"><\/script><p>\n\tEarlier this month, Edl and the final four of the 11 pro-life activists were convicted. The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Middle District of Tennessee indicated the octogenarian \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.justice.gov\/usao-mdtn\/pr\/four-defendants-found-guilty-federal-charges-after-obstructing-patients-and-providers\" target=\"_blank\">faces<\/a> up to six months in prison, five years of supervised released, and up to $10,000 in fines. It appears she was spared what could otherwise have been over a decade in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 because of the strictly nonviolent nature of her perceived offense.\n<\/p><p>\n\tEdl recently \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.dailysignal.com\/2024\/04\/21\/exclusive-she-survived-death-camp-facing-biden-doj-charges-shes-prepared-die-prison\/\" target=\"_blank\">told<\/a> the Daily Signal in an interview, \"When I was indicted, I began to prepare to die there.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"Right now, I'm ambivalent,\" she continued. \"I'm doing the best I can to get ready. Haven't talked to a funeral director yet.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"I'm just being sensible,\" added Edl. \"There's no guarantee that I survive it.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tEdl explained to the Daily Signal that her activism started when the issue was brought to her attention during an English course in 1968.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"I didn't know what [abortion] meant,\" she said. \"I tried to speak up in that subject, but I must have done a very bad job because I don't think I convinced the person that I was speaking with. And after that, I just brought the subject up all the time because it bothered me that people would actually think of killing their own children.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tShe made clear to her husband that inaction was unacceptable.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"We are doing what we are condemning others for,\" Edl recalled telling her husband. \"This is what people should have done for us.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tEdl began actively protesting abortion and staging rescues in the late 1980s, which landed her in jail even before Clinton signed the FACE Act into law.\n<\/p><p>\n\tDespite her conviction earlier this month, Edl maintains her actions were justified, certain that such protests can spare babies' lives today just as similar protests could have saved multitudes of lives in the mid-20th century.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"When we were rounded up to be killed, we were placed in cattle cars, and our train was headed toward the extermination camp. What if citizens of my country would have overcome their fear, and a number of them stood on those railroad tracks between the gate of the entrance to the death camp and the train?\" said Edl. \"The train would have to stop. And while the guards on those trains would be busy rounding up the ones that were in front of the train, another group could have come in, pried open our cattle car and possibly set us free, but nobody did.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"When we place our bodies between the woman and the clinic, we buy time to get our sidewalk counselors the opportunity to speak with women, and hopefully open their hearts with love for their babies and let their babies live,\" said Edl.\n<\/p><p>\n\tTommy Valentine, the director of accountability at CatholicVote, \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/opinion\/criminal-justice\/4603098-biden-doj-hounds-elderly-concentration-camp-survivor-serial-church-arsonist-skates\/\" target=\"_blank\">suggested<\/a> in an op-ed Monday, \"It is unquestionable that Eva and her pro-life compatriots' prosecutions are intended to send a message. The FBI and Department of Justice have prosecuted nonviolent pro-life offenders with the FACE Act, while turning a blind eye to the violent, ongoing and terrifying attacks on other institutions protected by the FACE Act: churches and pregnancy help centers.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tValentine noted that while Edl is likely headed to prison, the Biden DOJ has \"failed to federally prosecute a single one of the more than 400 egregious FACE Act violations against Catholic Churches since May 2020, or to meaningfully address the 90 attacks on pregnancy resource centers across the nation since May 2022.\"\n<\/p><p>\n\tLast year, Republicans Rep. Chip Roy (Texas) and Sen. Mike Lee (Utah) proposed \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/www.congress.gov\/bill\/118th-congress\/house-bill\/5577\/all-actions?s=1&r=76\" target=\"_blank\">legislation<\/a> that would repeal the FACE Act.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\"Free Americans should never live in fear of their government targeting them because of their beliefs. Yet, Biden's Department of Justice has brazenly weaponized the FACE Act against normal, everyday Americans across the political spectrum, simply because they are pro-life,\" Roy \n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/roy.house.gov\/media\/press-releases\/rep-chip-roy-fights-repeal-face-act\" target=\"_blank\">said<\/a> in a statement.\n<\/p><p>\n\tLee stated, \"Joe Biden's DOJ has weaponized this constitutionally dubious law against pro-life sidewalk counselors while failing to protect pregnancy centers and churches from arson, vandalism, and violence.

Mike Johnson of Louisiana. The twist: It was written in November 2018 \u2014 five years before Johnson rose to become the unlikely speaker of a deeply divided Republican House.\n<\/p><p class=\"pull-quote\">\n\tIt turns out that the ambitious Louisianan\u2019s careful presentation could conceal more than one play at a time.\n<\/p><p>\n\tPublished in the left-wing Daily Beast, the story's reporter used interviews with multiple Republican colleagues <a href=\"https:\/\/www.thedailybeast.com\/meet-the-double-agent-who-now-controls-house-conservatives\" target=\"_blank\">to paint Johnson<\/a> as an ambitious politician who downplayed his relationship with the conservative House Freedom Caucus in order to gain the acceptance, and the eventual chairmanship, of the powerful Republican Study Committee.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cFor two years,\u201d Andrew Desiderio wrote, \u201che was groomed and positioned, never denouncing but never formally affiliating with the Freedom Caucus and all the while getting closer and closer to his goal of total control over conservative Republicans in the House. And it worked.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tOf course, it\u2019s easy to see the story in a different light now that Johnson has climbed the ladder to the top of his conference and used his authority <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/columns\/opinion\/mike-johnson-betrays-border-security-for-more-foreign-aid\" target=\"_self\">to cut deals with Democrats<\/a>, most recently selling out border security to send more than $60 billion to Ukraine over the objections of a majority of his own party.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt turns out that the ambitious Louisianan\u2019s careful presentation could conceal more than one play at a time. Today, Johnson is effectively the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.theblaze.com\/columns\/opinion\/welcome-to-the-united-states-house-of-parliament\" target=\"_self\">head of a center-left coalition government<\/a>, having passed every important spending bill of his tenure with Democrats\u2019 support, and even relying on Democrats to protect him from being ousted from the speakership by the GOP.\n<\/p><p>\n\tIt\u2019s always more difficult to discern motives than it might seem, and much of what happens in Washington, D.C., is significantly closer to an episode of \u201cVeep\u201d than an episode of \u201cHouse of Cards.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cThere wasn\u2019t some grand strategy here,\u201d one current Freedom Caucus member told me, waving away theories that Johnson had kept a friendly distance from the caucus to protect his potential path to leadership. \u201cHe\u2019s contended, and others have, that it was strategic, but that\u2019s revisionist history.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\tJohnson\u2019s socially conservative credentials were solid before he took the speakership. He has the right friends, including his fellow Louisianan Tony Perkins, president of the Family Research Council, and he once took a lot of the right stances \u2014 but could be counted on to vote with leadership when pressure mounted.\n<\/p><p>\n\tWhen Republican leadership demanded a yes vote on the National Defense Authorization Act that signed women up for the draft, for example, Johnson, then a member of the powerful House Armed Services Committee, voted yes. When leadership asked members to bust budget caps for Biden\u2019s 2023 budget, he voted yes. When leadership wanted to pass a farm bill with all the handouts it entailed, he was a yes. The list goes on.\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cI think he\u2019s mobilized by a belief that to some degree he\u2019s called by God to be there to lead,\u201d the Freedom Caucus member, who asked not to be named to speak freely, explained. \u201cTo do the things that he believes he needs to do, like fund Ukraine, like cut deals to get bills funded, and yes, move up and use those conservative credentials to effectively have the conservative movement be behind him and to try to leverage that. But meanwhile, we\u2019re doing whatever the defense world wants us to do: Reauthorize FISA, bust caps, fund foreign aid.\u201d\n<\/p><p>\n\t\u201cThe speaker,\u201d the congressman continued, \u201cis who he is. This is someone who\u2019s been upfront that he wanted to get funding to Ukraine, he was upfront about not wanting to have a shutdown.

Nine years is a couple of NFL lifetimes.\u00a0<\/p><p>Jim Harbaugh is still stuck in his ways a bit, but he showed in the first two days of the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl\/draft\/\">NFL Draft<\/a> that he can also adapt.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Los Angeles Chargers came into the draft with a big need and a big want. Harbaugh said earlier this offseason that he believes offensive line <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/espn960sports\/status\/1773822711305052501\">is the most important position<\/a> because every position group depends on the line to be good. But offensive line wasn&#39;t a glaring need for the Chargers. Receiver was.\u00a0<\/p><p>The Chargers ended up doing well at both.\u00a0<\/p><p><strong><em>[<\/em><\/strong><a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl\/draft\/\"><strong><em>On IOS?

The Chargers still needed receivers after letting go of Keenan Allen and Mike Williams this offseason. They addressed that early in the second round by <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/sports.yahoo.com\/nfl-draft-jim-harbaughs-chargers-get-aggressive-trade-up-to-take-wr-ladd-mcconkey-232419065.html\">trading up to draft Georgia&#39;s Ladd McConkey<\/a>.\u00a0<\/p><p>McConkey would have fit just fine in the first round but teams preferred other talented receivers. When McConkey fell to 34th overall, the Chargers traded up three spots to get him and didn&#39;t give up much to move up. Justin Herbert should be happy to see McConkey come aboard.<\/p><p>He&#39;ll also be happy having Alt to pair with star left tackle Rashawn Slater on the line for the foreseeable future too. Harbaugh believes in starting with a dominant offensive line, and that&#39;s not the worst approach.\u00a0<\/p><p id=\"b83186a75548463fb2d33251bcaa1d38\"><core-module id=\"b83186a75548463fb2d33251bcaa1d38\" listid=\"c704c531-c56b-43a1-abe1-e8e2e88cd0c5\" subheadline=\"April 25-27 in Detroit\" title=\"2024 NFL Draft\" type=\"curatedLinks\"><\/p><p><\/p><p>&quot;I know the question is going to come up, &#39;What about a weapon?&#39; Offensive linemen, we look at as weapons,&quot; Harbaugh<a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/CoachspeakIndex\/status\/1783689697878802796\"> told the media on Thursday night<\/a>. &quot;That group, when we talk about attacking on offense, the offensive line is the tip of the spear.&quot;\u00a0<\/p><p>But the NFL has become even more of a passing game since Harbaugh left the San Francisco 49ers to coach the University of Michigan. And McConkey is the rare slot receiver who can stretch the field. He&#39;ll be a great fit with Herbert.\u00a0<\/p><p>Harbaugh wasn&#39;t coming out of the draft without drafting a Michigan player, and he got one with linebacker Junior Colson in the third round. That&#39;s a need for the Chargers too, so we&#39;ll allow Harbaugh that one.\u00a0<\/p><p>Harbaugh was a big-time hire by the Chargers, but there&#39;s no guarantee he&#39;ll have immediate success. The Chargers took on some losses due to salary cap issues. But they rebounded well with a strong draft. Harbaugh has been gone for a while, but it seems he still knows how to build a winner.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p><figure><img alt=\"Los Angeles Chargers coach Jim Harbaugh added a couple of offensive standouts to start the NFL Draft.

        "description": "<p>Devastating tornadoes are tearing across parts of eastern Nebraska and Iowa on Friday as a multiday severe thunderstorm event ramped up in the central United States, injuring at least three people.<\/p>\n<p>Storms began in parts of the Plains and South early Friday afternoon. The National Weather Service had received <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.spc.noaa.gov\/climo\/reports\/today.html\">at least 60 reports of tornadoes<\/a> in at least five states as of 9:30 p.m. ET, making today the busiest day for tornadoes in the US in more than a year.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to tornado warnings, there have been 19 damaging wind reports and 45 hail reports from Friday\u2019s severe weather outbreak. Three of those hail reports were at least 2 inches in diameter, approximately lime-sized.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here\u2019s what we know so far:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has issued a disaster proclamation for Pottawattamie County in response to Friday\u2019s severe weather. <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/IAGovernor\/status\/1784032154554433734\">In a tweet<\/a>, the Republican governor said the proclamation was to support storm recovery efforts in the town of Minden. Tornado warnings were in effect for portions of the Des Moines metro area as of 9:45 p.m. ET.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 On Friday, a tornado roared through the outskirts of Lincoln, Nebraska, tearing the roofs off homes and crossing part of I-80 in the process. An overturned tractor-trailer, blown over by the storms, brought traffic to a slow crawl on the interstate, <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/new.511.nebraska.gov\/event\/NECARS5-36687\/@-96.58858,40.90059,14?show=roadReports,trafficSpeeds#camera\/187\/3348534971\">traffic cameras showed<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 In Elkhorn, an area on the edge of Omaha, first responders are still combing through the wreckage left behind by the tornado, searching through flattened homes for anyone trapped or injured, local authorities announced at a Friday news conference. The area is grappling with power outages, gas leaks, toppled trees, and unstable structures. Two people were transported for medical treatment with minor injuries. \u201cWe think injuries were so little because the warning systems in the City of Omaha and Douglas County were highly effective,\u201d Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer said. \u201cWe were not hit with a sudden storm. People had warned of this, which saved lives, in our opinion.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 One storm chaser described a \u201cvery devastating situation\u201d after a tornado barreled through Elkhorn. \u201cSome houses have been swept and no longer exist,\u201d Thomas Hinterdorfer told CNN. \u201cMost homes in this immediate area have suffered significant damage and it\u2019s likely going to be a long clean up effort.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Shelby and Douglas County emergency management officials in Nebraska said they have received no reports of severe injuries from Friday\u2019s storms. Alex Londo, Shelby County\u2019s emergency coordinator said there has been substantial property damage. \u201cFirst responders are out assessing the needs at this time,\u201d Londo told CNN. And Leia Baez, communications director for Douglas County, said there were no serious injuries or fatalities from the tornadoes in Elkhorn, Bennington and Waterloo but many homes were severely damaged, displacing residents. An American Red Cross shelter has been opened in Elkhorn.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Omaha\u2019s Eppley Airfield, the largest airport serving the region, was briefly closed Friday so officials could do a damage assessment, according to a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/OMAairport\/status\/1783983626352308408\">post on X<\/a>. The airport reopened around 6 p.m. local time after closing \u201cdue to storm activity\u201d, according to Tim Schmitt, Chief Operations Officer with Omaha Airport Authority. Some planes and hangars were damaged, he added. In a statement, the airport said passengers in the terminal were placed in storm shelters ahead of the tornado and no injuries were reported.<\/p>\n<p>\u2022 Multiple cars of a train derailed near Waverly, Nebraska, after it was struck by a tornado, according to a railway spokesperson.

Tornado sirens blared as a line of supercell thunderstorms raked through the Lincoln and Omaha areas, some of which produced what appeared to be massive, damaging tornadoes.<\/p>\n<p>Tornadoes continue to spawn Friday evening as storms track east into Iowa and northern Missouri. The National Weather Service issued a tornado emergency for a large tornado that was confirmed near Harlan, Iowa. Meteorologists noted it was a \u201cparticularly dangerous situation\u201d in which \u201ccatastrophic damage\u201d was likely.<\/p>\n<p>A Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms extends from parts of Iowa and Nebraska south into northeast Texas.

The tornado risk will continue to increase into the evening hours.<\/p>\n<p>Heavy rainfall with rates up to 2 inches per hour could cause flooding in parts of Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Missouri.<\/p>\n<p>Parts of Missouri were deluged with rain on Thursday, prompting flash flood warnings in the Springfield area, where more than half a month\u2019s worth of rain fell. Additional heavy rainfall Friday could allow floodwaters to rise faster and pose an even greater hazard.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-saturday-potential-to-be-the-most-dangerous-day\">Saturday: Potential to be the most dangerous day<\/h3>\n<p>Saturday could be the most dangerous day of the four if certain atmospheric conditions align.

Damaging storms are still likely in this scenario, they could just fail to reach their peak potential strength.<\/p>\n<p>But if storms quickly clear out Saturday morning, there won\u2019t be much of a limit on how strong storms could become.<\/p>\n<p>The most significant storms are possible starting in the afternoon in parts of the southern and central Plains, where a Level 3 of 5 risk of severe thunderstorms is in place. Widespread damaging wind gusts, hail up to the size of baseballs and strong tornadoes are the storms\u2019<strong>&nbsp;<\/strong>main hazards.<\/p>\n<p>The tornado threat could ramp up considerably through the late afternoon and evening hours with \u201cmultiple strong tornadoes\u201d possible, according to the prediction center.<\/p>\n<p>Damaging storms are possible outside of the greatest risk area in a huge area of the country from the Great Lakes to southern Texas.<\/p>\n<p>A \u201csignificant rainfall event\u201d could unfold Saturday, the Weather Prediction Center warned. Some locations could record close to 5 inches of rain in a short period and dangerous flash flooding could result. A handful of locations caught under multiple rounds of gushing rainfall could have totals approach the 8-inch mark.<\/p>\n<p>A Level 3 of 4 risk of excessive rainfall is in place for a large portion of Oklahoma \u2013 including Oklahoma City and Tulsa \u2013 and smaller parts of Kansas and Texas. Intense rainfall could force streams to overflow their banks and flood roadways.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-sunday-plains-mississippi-valley-midwest\">Sunday: Plains, Mississippi Valley, Midwest<\/h3>\n<p>Damaging storms are possible from Texas to Wisconsin Sunday.

        "description": "<p><em>South Bend, Indiana<\/em> &mdash; Gene Eyster, a retired police lieutenant, cannot drive past one specific apartment complex here without reliving that strange day 24 years ago.<\/p><p>&quot;That was one of the strangest calls I think I&#39;ve ever had: &#39;We have a found baby in a box,&#39;&quot; Eyster, a 47-year veteran of the department, told CBS News. &quot;You always wonder, what happened?&quot;<\/p><p>On Dec. 22, 2000, a newborn was found abandoned in a common hallway. For Eyster, the case of the &quot;Baby Boy Doe,&quot; swaddled in cardboard and blankets, didn&#39;t end after the child got to the hospital.<\/p><p>&quot;I went back with a teddy bear,&quot; Eyster said. &quot;Just a symbol to let everyone that walked past know that he was cared about.&quot;<\/p><p>For more than two decades, Eyster wondered what became of that boy. Unfortunately, records were sealed so there was no way to find out.<\/p><p>That was until just a few weeks ago, when Eyster got a phone call from a fellow officer, who asked Eyster if remembered the case of the baby left in the carboard box.&nbsp;<\/p><p>&quot;And he (the officer) said, &#39;he&#39;s (the baby) sitting next to me, he&#39;s my rookie,&#39;&quot; Eyster recounted. &nbsp;<\/p><p>The rookie in question was Matthew Hegedus-Stewart, the baby in the box. After his rescue, he was placed for adoption. He always knew he had been left in a box, but only connected the dots to Eyster after joining the department.<\/p><p>Today, Hegedus-Stewart wears the same uniform Eyster did and patrols the same neighborhood.<\/p><p>&quot;Full circle moment,&quot; Hegedus-Stewart said. &quot;That hit home. I can only imagine from his point of view.&quot;<\/p><p>He really can&#39;t imagine. Because what to Hegedus-Stewart may feel like a coincidence, to Eyster feels divined. Their reunion and their new friendship came just a few months after Eyster&#39;s only son, Nick, died unexpectedly at the age of 36.<\/p><p>&quot;So the timing couldn&#39;t have been any better, it helped to fill a void that I&#39;ve had to deal with,&quot; Eyster said. <\/p><p>Twenty-four years ago, Eyster was called to be there for a child in need.&nbsp; Now, the child is set to return the favor.&nbsp; And whether it&#39;s a coincidence or not, the result is undeniably great police work.<\/p>\n<p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/rhona-graff-former-trump-assistant-takes-stand-new-york-trial?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">Rhona Graff, former Trump assistant, takes the stand at his New York trial<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/new-yorks-highest-court-overturns-harvey-weinstein-verdict?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">New York&#39;s highest court overturns Harvey Weinstein verdict<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/another-american-arrested-in-turks-and-caicos-after-bullets-found-in-luggage?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">Another American arrested in Turks and Caicos after bullets found in luggage<\/a><\/p>\n",

Her family said they hadn\u2019t heard from her, however, and while relatives tried to piece together what happened, a detective revealed something Fran\u2019s family hadn\u2019t previously known: Smith had been married before.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Decades earlier, he\u2019d eloped with Janice Elaine Hartman after high school, another detective, Dave Mansue, told \u201cDateline.\u201d But the couple split in 1974, after only a few years. <\/p><p>After tracking down a relative of Hartman\u2019s, the family learned an even more startling detail: Days after they divorced, Hartman disappeared and was never heard from again. Authorities in Ohio believed she was a runaway and didn\u2019t pursue the case as a possible homicide, Mansue said.<\/p><p>Smith offered strangely similar accounts and details in the disappearances of both wives, the detectives found. In a missing person\u2019s report, Smith said he believed Hartman had gone to Florida with a red suitcase, Dansbury said. In Fran\u2019s disappearance, he said he believed she\u2019d gone to Florida to visit family with a yellow suitcase, Dansbury recalled.&nbsp;<\/p><p>When Fran disappeared, authorities discovered that Smith had a long-time girlfriend \u2014 an HR manager he\u2019d met while applying for a job \u2014 living at a Connecticut beach house he owned. Frank Barre, a detective with the Milford Police Department who began assisting in the investigation, recalled that the girlfriend didn\u2019t know that Smith had been married twice. Nor did she know that both women had disappeared.<\/p><p>\u201cHer whole world was upside down,\u201d Barre told \u201cDateline.\u201d<\/p><div><img alt=\"Dateline (Dateline)\" height=\"1283\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_nbc_universal_184\/287d70280283bc6b4c1be120d39f906e\" width=\"875\" data-uuid=\"e791f2c9-6dd0-350c-8303-5b7334e52631\"><\/div><p>The girlfriend agreed to call Smith and allow investigators to listen in and record the conversation.<\/p><p>She confronted him about his relationship with Fran, according to audio of the call, and asked if she was dead. Smith told her he didn\u2019t think so but \u2014 because he didn\u2019t know where she was \u2014 \u201cthey think I must have hurt her,\u201d according to audio.<\/p><p>When she asked about Hartman, he said they\u2019d divorced and he\u2019d reported her missing. He said he\u2019d only just learned that she\u2019d never been found, according to the audio.<\/p><p>When she asked if he\u2019d lied during a police polygraph test, he said: \u201cI failed it.\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cWait, John,\u201d she said. \u201cDid you lie during the test?\u201d<\/p><p>\u201cYes, I lied during the test,\u201d he said.<\/p><h2><strong>A long-held secret revealed<\/strong><\/h2><p>Investigators suspected that Smith was responsible for the disappearances of his wives, but didn\u2019t have proof. It wasn\u2019t until years later, after Hilland took over the investigations in 1998, that authorities got a break.<\/p><p>By then, Smith had moved to suburban San Diego, remarried and was working for a car maker. On May 5, 1999, Hilland organized an effort with FBI agents across the country to carry out a series of coordinated interviews with people linked to Smith \u2014 relatives, colleagues and exes \u2014 and with Smith himself.<\/p><p>During an hourslong interview with Smith, Hilland said he repeatedly confronted him about inconsistencies in his accounts of what happened to Fran and Hartman. When the agent confronted him about lying on the polygraph, Smith denied making the comment, Hilland said.<\/p><p>\u201cI pulled out the tape recorder, hit play, and John could hear in his own voice all those things that he had said,\u201d Hilland said about playing the taped conversation between Smith and his onetime girlfriend. Smith \u201cturned beet red and shrugged his shoulders.\u201d<\/p><p>At one point, Hilland said, Smith offered a hypothetical about two people having an argument and one of them being fatally struck by a bus.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Smith asked, \u201cIs the other person responsible for a murder?\u201d Hilland said. \u201cWe said, \u2018No, that\u2019s an accident. That would not be a murder. Is that what happened to Fran?\u2019 He said, \u2018I don\u2019t know what happened to Fran. I just know she isn\u2019t dead. If she\u2019s dead, she\u2019s probably in heaven.\u201d<\/p><p>Smith told investigators he was having a heart attack, and the interview ended, Hilland said. But days later, the former investigator said, Smith\u2019s brother shared something with <strong>t<\/strong>he FBI that he hadn\u2019t previously disclosed.<\/p><div><img alt=\"Dateline (Dateline)\" height=\"1969\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_nbc_universal_184\/40d9676693085980bf4f9f9113330a97\" width=\"2500\" data-uuid=\"cddcbc1a-c7fb-3342-9f11-7aad91fb248f\"><\/div><p>In exchange for an agreement that barred prosecutors from charging him, <strong>the sibling<\/strong> revealed that in November 1974 he\u2019d seen Smith with a large plywood box in a garage next to his grandparents\u2019 house in Ohio.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Smith was crying, Hilland recalled the brother saying, and appeared to be placing clothes that he believed belonged to Hartman in the box.<\/p><p>The box, which had been nailed shut, remained in the garage for five years, until his grandfather pried it open, Smith\u2019s brother told investigators. The brother said he saw what appeared to be Hartman\u2019s remains inside the box, Hilland said.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Her legs had been removed and her hair appeared to be rainbow-colored \u2014 a detail authorities later attributed to clothing dye bleeding onto her body, Hilland said.<\/p><p>The discovery haunted the sibling for years, Hilland recalled, but he hadn\u2019t come forward because his grandfather had asked him to stay silent.<\/p><p>\u201cThe grandfather said, \u2018If we call the sheriff, this is gonna cause your grandmother to die,\u2019\u201d Hilland recalled the sibling saying.<\/p><p>After the brother called Smith and told him he\u2019d found the box, Smith arrived at the grandparents\u2019 home, put the box in the passenger seat of his Corvette and drove off, Hilland said the brother told officials.<\/p><div><\/div><p>After his revelation to the FBI, Smith\u2019s brother agreed to confront his sibling. In the conversation, which was recorded, Smith described the box as a \u201cjoke\u201d and said someone had dropped it off with a dead goat inside, according to a transcript of the call.<\/p><p>At one point, the brother said: \u201cI had nightmares where Jan chased me down the road, beat me with her legs, John.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cOK,\u201d Smith replied.<\/p><p>Nearly a year later, remains were exhumed from a rural Indiana cemetery and, in April 2000, positively identified as belonging to Hartman.&nbsp;<\/p><p>Years earlier, it turned out, a road crew had found the box described by Smith\u2019s sibling in a roadside drainage ditch, but the remains couldn\u2019t be identified and the body was buried in what Hilland described as a Jane Doe grave.<\/p><p>Six months after the identification, Smith was charged with murder in Hartman\u2019s killing. He pleaded not guilty and was convicted at trial. In 2001, Smith was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison.<\/p><h2><strong>The case falls apart<\/strong><\/h2><p>After that conviction, Hilland continued searching for Fran. He said he organized multiple excavations at Smith\u2019s workplace in New Jersey and the Connecticut beach home, and he worked with undercover informants at the prison where Smith was incarcerated to try and gather information. Neither efforts yielded evidence, he said.<\/p><p>Prosecutors from Mercer County later met with Hilland at the FBI Training Academy in Virginia, where he was working as an instructor. Although there was no new evidence, the prosecutor\u2019s office said in its statement, after the meeting, they believed they had enough to charge Smith in Fran\u2019s 1991 disappearance.<\/p><p>In November 2019, Smith was indicted on a charge of first-degree murder after prosecutors presented evidence to a grand jury about both Fran\u2019s disappearance and Hartman\u2019s killing.<\/p><p>\u201cIt was the state\u2019s position that, in 1991, Smith believed he had a successful blueprint to get away with murder and followed his 1974 playbook but corrected the only mistake he made in the murder of Janice Hartman \u2014 keeping her body in a place where it would be accidentally discovered,\u201d the prosecutor\u2019s office said.<\/p><p>But in 2022, the statement said, a judge barred prosecutors from presenting evidence from Hartman\u2019s murder, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nj.com\/mercer\/2022\/10\/jury-will-not-hear-that-man-accused-of-killing-2nd-wife-is-in-prison-for-murdering-his-1st.html\" target=\"_blank\">ruling<\/a> that it would unfairly prejudice the jury. Faced with the impending dismissal of charges, the statement said, prosecutors entered into an agreement with Smith.<\/p><p>Because Fran\u2019s body had never been found, the statement said, the likelihood of uncovering new evidence and pursuing a successful prosecution appeared \u201cminimal.\u201d To provide closure for the family, the statement said, prosecutors agreed to drop the murder charge if he revealed what he did with Fran\u2019s remains.<\/p><p>The prosecutor\u2019s office didn\u2019t require corroborating evidence to back up the account \u2014 \u201crecovery\u201d would have been impossible given how long ago she disappeared, the statement said \u2014 nor did they require Smith to say how he killed her.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cIn negotiating the non-prosecution agreement, Smith would not admit to the murder but would agree to tell us what he did with her body,\u201d the spokesperson said in an email.<\/p><p>Prosecutors shared what Smith said with Fran\u2019s family but didn\u2019t reveal the details publicly, according to the statement. Deanna Childers, Fran\u2019s daughter, told \u201cDateline\u201d that officials told the family that Smith confessed to wrapping her mother\u2019s body in a blanket and leaving her in a dumpster at the factory where he worked in New Jersey.<\/p><p>Davis, Fran Smith\u2019s sister, said the idea that the deal provided closure for her family was an insult. She didn\u2019t believe Smith\u2019s account, she said, adding that the information did \u201cnothing\u201d for her family.<\/p><p>Hilland, who retired from the FBI in 2022, was outraged that the deal didn\u2019t require a full confession or corroborating evidence. He said it seemed highly unlikely that Smith would have left Fran\u2019s body in a trash bin at a factory with many employees who easily could have noticed.&nbsp;<\/p><p>To Hilland, there was so much circumstantial evidence implicating Smith in Fran\u2019s alleged killing \u2014 including when he told his then-girlfriend in the recorded call that he lied to police while they were questioning him about Fran\u2019s disappearance \u2014 that he believed prosecutors could have proven his guilt.&nbsp;<\/p><p>\u201cShame on them for accepting\u201d his account, Hilland said, \u201cbecause now they\u2019ve given him immunity based on that.\u201d<\/p><p>Hilland added that when John Smith goes for his next parole hearing in 2029, he may have a better chance of getting out because he can say he cooperated with authorities.<\/p>",

        "description": "<p>By Tim Reid <\/p><p>  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -     Kristi Noem, a contender to become Republican Donald Trump&#39;svice presidential running mate, defended herself on Friday against Democratic attacks over her account of shooting a dog on her family farm. <\/p><p>  Noem, the governor of South Dakota, describes killing an &quot;untrainable&quot; dog called Cricket which she &quot;hated&quot; in an upcoming memoir, excerpts of which were first published by The Guardian on Friday. She also said she shot to death a goat. <\/p><p>  Noem said the dog ruined a hunt and later attacked chickens owned by a local family, behaved like a &quot;trained assassin,&quot; and was &quot;dangerous to anyone she came in contact with.&quot; <\/p><p>  &quot;I realized I had to put her down,&quot; Noem writes. <\/p><p>  The Democratic National Committee seized on the excerpts, calling them &quot;horrifying&quot; and &quot;disturbing&quot; and tried to make a 2024 election argument about the shooting of the animals. <\/p><p>  &quot;If you want elected officials who don&#39;t brag about brutally killing their pets as part of their self-promotional book tour, then listen to our owners \u2013 and vote Democrat,&quot; the DNC said in a statement, giving voice to the dogs. <\/p><p>  Responding on X, Noem said, &quot;We love animals, but tough decisions like this happen all the time on a farm. Sadly, we just had to put down 3 horses a few weeks ago that had been in our family for 25 years.&quot; <\/p><p>  Noem is on a list of candidates being considered by Trump to be his vice presidential running mate, friends and allies of Trump have told Reuters. Trump faces a general election rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden on Nov. 5. <\/p><p>  Colleen O&#39;Brien, senior director at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), decried Noem&#39;s decision to kill the dog. <\/p><p>  She criticized Noem for allowing &quot;this rambunctious puppy loose on chickens and then punishing her by deciding to personally blow her brains out rather than attempting to train her or find a more responsible guardian who would provide her with a proper home.&quot; <\/p><p>  (Reporting by Tim Reid, editing by Ross Colvin and Sandra Maler) <\/p>",

        "description": "<p>American workers by and large believe they&#39;ll retire at 65, the nation&#39;s traditional retirement age. But real life often gets in the way of those plans, with new research finding that the majority actually step back from work far earlier. And for many, it&#39;s not by choice.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The median retirement age for Americans is actually 62, meaning that the typical worker is stepping back from their career three years earlier than expected, according to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ebri.org\/retirement\/retirement-confidence-survey?ftag=YHF4eb9d17\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">new research<\/a> from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit focused on employee benefit programs.&nbsp;<\/p><p>The findings underscore the gap between retirement goals and reality.

In reality, however, many U.S. seniors are forced into retirement before they&#39;re ready. &nbsp;<\/p><p>But even when people want to work longer, they&#39;re not always able to, the new research found.<\/p><p>&quot;It&#39;s hard to make that case that everyone should work longer and that will solve the problems we have in retirement,&quot; Craig Copeland, director of wealth benefits research at EBRI, told CBS MoneyWatch. &quot;That clearly won&#39;t solve all the problems because many people just can&#39;t do it.&quot;<\/p><p>Seven in 10 retirees stopped working before they turned 65, the report found. Overall, about half said they stopped working before they had expected, with the majority blaming reasons out of their control. For instance, about one-third cited a health issue or disability for their earlier-than-expected retirement.<\/p><p>Only about 2 in 5 said they stopped working earlier than expected because they could afford to do so, the research found.<\/p><iframe title=\"When retirement is beyond your control\" id=\"datawrapper-chart-87ibE\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"width:0;min-width:100% !important;border:none;\" height=\"279\"><\/iframe>!function(){&quot;use strict&quot;;window.addEventListener(&quot;message&quot;,(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;]){var e=document.querySelectorAll(&quot;iframe&quot;);for(var t in a.data[&quot;datawrapper-height&quot;])for(var r=0;r<p><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/rhona-graff-former-trump-assistant-takes-stand-new-york-trial?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">Rhona Graff, former Trump assistant, takes the stand at his New York trial<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/new-yorks-highest-court-overturns-harvey-weinstein-verdict?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">New York&#39;s highest court overturns Harvey Weinstein verdict<\/a><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/videos\/another-american-arrested-in-turks-and-caicos-after-bullets-found-in-luggage?ftag=YHFaf537c7\">Another American arrested in Turks and Caicos after bullets found in luggage<\/a><\/p>\n",

        "description": "<p>A ubiquitous, resilient and seemingly harmless plant is fueling an increase in large, fast-moving and destructive wildfires in the United States.<\/p>\n<p>Grass is as plentiful as sunshine, and under the right weather conditions <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2024\/03\/03\/climate\/texas-wildfires-climate-change\/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\">is like gasoline for wildfires<\/a>: All it takes is a spark for it to explode.<\/p>\n<p>Planet-warming emissions are wreaking havoc on temperature and precipitation, resulting in larger and more frequent fires. Those fires are fueling the vicious cycle of ecological destruction that are helping to make grass king.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cName an environment and there\u2019s a grass that can survive there,\u201d said Adam Mahood, research ecologist with the US Department of Agriculture\u2019s research service. \u201cAny 10-foot area that\u2019s not paved is going to have some kind of grass on it.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grass fires are typically less intense and shorter-lived than forest fires, but can spread exponentially faster, outrun firefighting resources and burn into the growing number of homes being built closer to fire-prone wildlands, fire experts told CNN.<\/p>\n<p>Over the last three decades, the number of US homes destroyed by wildfire has more than doubled as fires burn bigger and badder,  <a href=\"https:\/\/www.science.org\/doi\/10.1126\/science.ade9223\">a recent study found<\/a>. Most of those homes were burned not by forest fires, but by fires racing through grass and shrubs.<\/p>\n<p>The West is most at risk, the study found, where more than two-thirds of the homes burned over the last 30 years were located. Of those, nearly 80% were burned in grass and shrub fires.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Christmas lights adorn a house as the Marshall Fire rages in the background on December 30, 2021, in Louisville, Colorado. - Helen H.

Richardson\/MediaNews Gr\/Denver Post\/Getty Images<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>One part of the equation is people are building closer to fire-prone wildlands, in the so-called wildland-urban interface. The amount of land burning in this sensitive area has grown exponentially since the 1990s. So has the number of houses. Around 44 million houses were in the interface as of 2020, an increase of 46% over the last 30 years, the same study found.<\/p>\n<p>Building in areas more likely to burn comes with obvious risks, but because humans are also responsible <a href=\"https:\/\/www.pnas.org\/doi\/10.1073\/pnas.1617394114\">for starting most fires<\/a>, it also increases the chance a fire will ignite in the first place.<\/p>\n<p>More than 80,000 homes are in the wildland-urban interface, in the sparsely populated parts of Kansas and Colorado that Bill King manages. The US Forest Service officer said living on the edge of nature requires an active hand to prevent destruction.<\/p>\n<p>Property owners \u201cneed to do their part too, because these fires \u2013 they get so big and intense and sometimes wind-driven that they could spot miles ahead even if we have a huge fuel break,\u201d King said.<\/p>\n<h3>\u2018A perfect storm\u2019 for fire<\/h3>\n<p>Climate change-fueled fire is attacking the western half of the US on all fronts.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cGlobally, the places that burn the most are places that have intermediate precipitation,\u201d said John Abatzoglou, a climate professor at the University of California, Merced. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like Goldilocks. Not too wet, not too dry, just right, with plenty of ignition.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>In America\u2019s grassy heartland, the typically dry and often windy Plains, a series of compounding extremes across seasons are creating ideal fire fuel conditions in perennial grasses. Grass is more plentiful here than in other regions in the US, offering more continuous fuel for fires to feed off.<\/p>\n<p>The region is seeing <a href=\"https:\/\/nca2023.globalchange.gov\/chapter\/26\/\">more megafires<\/a> like Texas\u2019s largest fire, the Smokehouse Creek Fire, and more destructive ones like <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2022\/01\/01\/us\/colorado-wildfires-saturday\/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\">Colorado\u2019s Marshall Fire<\/a>, which burned through more than 1,000 homes in 2021.<\/p>\n<p>Rainy springs fuel more grass growth. Then it goes dormant, or plays dead, in the winter. Warmer winters with less snow cover, especially in <a href=\"https:\/\/nca2023.globalchange.gov\/chapter\/25\/\">the Northern Plains<\/a>, expose the grass to warmer, drier spells in the late winter and early spring, according to King and Todd Lindley, a fire weather expert for the National Weather Service in Norman, Oklahoma.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"The charred remains of vehicles sit behind a shop that was destroyed by the Smokehouse Creek fire when it burned its way through the Texas Panhandle on March 2, 2024. - Scott Olson\/Getty Images\" height=\"540\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_cnn_articles_945\/01c079bf357d7149b17a5e7639b9d2e4\" width=\"960\" data-uuid=\"8f795eff-5efb-3c34-9c07-563399d94af6\"><figcaption>The charred remains of vehicles sit behind a shop that was destroyed by the Smokehouse Creek fire when it burned its way through the Texas Panhandle on March 2, 2024. - Scott Olson\/Getty Images<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Grass is uniquely flammable because of its sensitivity to weather, Lindley said. Unlike in forests, it doesn\u2019t take long spells of warm, dry weather to turn grass to tinder. Moisture can be sapped from the plant in as little as an hour and even a day after rain. Throw in a spark, strong winds and invasive shrubs that burn hotter and longer and you have a recipe for grass fire disaster.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cThese compound extremes, these sequences of extremes that follow one another, if you get the right sequence, it can be game on for this sort of wildfire,\u201d Abatzoglou said. \u201cBasically, you\u2019re creating a perfect storm for the fire to spread there.\u201d<\/p>\n<h3>Grass invasion<\/h3>\n<p>Extreme drought and years of forest neglect are creating larger and more intense fires in western forests, King said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen I started 30 years ago, a big fire was 30,000 acres, and now that\u2019s normal, that\u2019s typical,\u201d said King. \u201cI\u2019d have maybe one a year, one every couple of years of that size, and now we hear of 1-million-acre forest fires.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Grass exists in forest systems, too, and acts like a fuse to connect easier-to-ignite finer fuels to larger, drought-impacted tree systems, creating and spreading more intense fires.<\/p>\n<p>When the trees die, grass moves in. Grass recovers from fire much faster than other plants and can burn again, sometimes within a matter of months. King has seen this firsthand.<\/p>\n<figure><img alt=\"Burned cars and homes are seen in a neighborhood that was destroyed by a wildfire on August 18, 2023 in Lahaina, Hawaii.

The same drought-fueled fires are now becoming bigger in deserts because of annual grasses, which unlike the perennial grasses in the Plains, don\u2019t exist year-round.<\/p>\n<p> These grasses take advantage of rare bursts of rain to propagate, then die, forming a carpet of fire fuel on the desert floor.<\/p>\n<p>Two recent fires in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnn.com\/2023\/08\/02\/us\/york-fire-california-nevada-wednesday\/index.html?cid=external-feeds_iluminar_yahoo\">California\u2019s Mojave National Preserve<\/a> are perfect examples, Mahood said. Those fires took advantage of invasive red brome grass and burned hundreds of thousands of acres of Mojave Desert and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nps.gov\/moja\/learn\/nature\/dome-fire.htm\">over a million iconic Joshua Trees<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The increasing hot and dry conditions then suppress native plant recovery.&nbsp; The result is more grass.<\/p>\n<p>The West\u2019s stubby, iconic sagebrush <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fws.gov\/program\/sagebrush-conservation#:~:text=Sagebrush%20country%20contains%20biological%2C%20cultural,of%20the%20continental%20lower%2048.\">is the single biggest ecosystem in the Lower 48<\/a>, but half of it has been lost or degraded over the last 20 years.

His mom, he said, did not want him to turn down a man who was vying to become the first Black president.<\/p>\n<p>Biden told Stern: \u201cShe said, \u2018Joey, let me \u2014 remember\u2019 \u2014 true story, she said \u2014  \u2018Remember when they were desegregating Lynnfield, the neighborhood \u2026 suburbia \u2014 and I told you \u2014 and there was a Black family moving in and there was \u2014 people were down there protesting; I told you not to go down there and you went down, remember that?

No other Biden memoir, either, says he was arrested at such a protest.<\/p>\n<p>The Post and PolitiFact did find that there were protests roughly matching Biden\u2019s description in early 1959, when Biden was 16 years old, in communities not far from Biden\u2019s home in Delaware. Crowds protested against a Black couple that had bought a home in a previously all-White community and against the realtor who sold it to them.<\/p>\n<p>But the Wilmington News Journal <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.documentcloud.org\/documents\/21178514-25-feb-1959-page-1-the-news-journal-at-newspaperscom\">reported<\/a> that the four teenagers arrested at the protest at the couple\u2019s home were arrested for possessing fireworks \u2014 and that all seven of the arrests that day were of people in the anti-integration crowd outside the home. The newspaper reported that the police on scene were defending the home and the Black couple. It also quoted one member of the couple as saying, \u201cNobody\u2019s behind us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s impossible to definitively prove whether or not Biden was present at this protest or any similar protest 60-plus years ago.

        "description": "<p>I love chocolate as much as the next person, but I&#39;ve never considered myself much of a chocolate snob. Sure, I love whipping something up using <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/lifestyle\/heilala-vanilla-paste-review-112639595.html\">fancy vanilla bean paste<\/a> and have even found a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/lifestyle\/buttermilk-alternative-powdered-buttermilk-review-114320301.html\">powdered buttermilk hack<\/a> that makes impromptu baking super simple, but I&#39;m hardly ever in the mood for something chocolatey. Given the choice between a dessert that&#39;s fruity and fresh or rich and chocolatey, and I&#39;ll choose the fruity option every time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>It&#39;s probably why I&#39;m more likely to pick up a chocolate bar that has anything but, well, plain ol&#39; chocolate in it. Salted caramel, fruits and nuts, sea salt, even jam \u2014 if the chocolate has something else going on in it, then it&#39;s probably better for my palate.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>All of that is to set up why, on a recent trip to Italy, I was strolling through the hilly and winding side streets of Perguia and was surprised to find myself in the overwhelmingly robust chocolate section of a small <em>bottega. <\/em>I&#39;d stopped to find souvenirs to bring home to some friends and family, but as I was checking out with their gifts, I picked up this Venchi Pistachio Cremino chocolate bar on impulse \u2014 and I&#39;m eternally grateful I did. Just one square of this chocolate has since ruined all other chocolate for me, and that&#39;s not an overstatement.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"3c78f90bbef3498788eec641c51050bc\" data-type=\"product-list\"\/><\/p>\n<p>You might&#39;ve heard of or seen Venchi chocolate before. It&#39;s a gourmet Italian chocolate brand that was founded in Turin, Italy, in 1878. But what makes Venchi chocolate super special is that it&#39;s made with genuine ingredients that are inspired by Mediterranean diets. Lots of their chocolates are made with ingredients like almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios and, perhaps most famously, gianduja \u2014 a Turin creation that&#39;s traditionally chocolate with about 30% hazelnut paste. It makes for a creamy, nutty, slightly sweet chocolate that looks and tastes luxurious.<\/p>\n<p>Venchi&#39;s Pistachio Cremino bar is made with alternating layers of that creamy gianduja and delicate, lightly salted pistachio cream spread \u2014 a truly Italian flavor. The result is a decadent, melt-in-your-mouth chocolate that has a silky, soft texture and isn&#39;t overwhelmingly sweet. It&#39;s an intoxicating treat for those who know they love the flavors of chocolate, pistachio and hazelnut.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><core-commerce id=\"9a039457b80a4edb99ada6a2814ac54a\" data-type=\"product-list\"\/><\/p>\n<p>Finding this decadent chocolate bar is one of the reasons that I always make a point to stop into a local grocery store or two when I&#39;m traveling abroad. It&#39;s not only a really smart place to load up on tons of affordable souvenirs, but I genuinely find it interesting to browse the ingredients and brands that might be unfamiliar to me. Even mundane things like going to the grocery store aren&#39;t <em>really<\/em> all that mundane when you&#39;re in a foreign country.

This process creates alcohols and vinegars that attract fruit flies, but also makes them less appealing to us,\u201d Dr. Stevison continues.<\/p><p> \u201cJust like humans, the flies select an environment that is best for their children. So, think of rotting fruit like the hunt for the best schools! This provides a rich source of nutrients for them to lay their eggs.\u201d <\/p><p>It\u2019s important to take action as soon as you see the very first fruit fly.<\/p><p>\u201cA single mated female can lay over 100 eggs,\u201d Dr. Stevison says. \u201cThese take about 10 days to hatch as adults. This means if you miss trash day, then you can expect a big swarm of fruit flies before the next week. Also, if you ignore a few fruit flies because you are busy, it can become a BIG problem very fast.\u201d <br><\/p><p>So, take note: Your cleanup clock starts immediately. Pronto. No waiting.<\/p><h2 class=\"body-h2\">What is the fastest way to get rid of fruit flies? <\/h2><h3 class=\"body-h3\"><strong>Step 1: Clean<\/strong><\/h3><p class=\"body-text\">Fruit flies hate clean surfaces, so clear off all of the clutter and wipe down your countertops as well as your sink. Trust us: If you skip this step, you\u2019ll be fighting a losing battle against the bugs. <strong><\/strong> <\/p><ul><li><strong>Throw out too-ripe or rotting produce. <\/strong>Check all fruits and vegetables for rot, decay, or overripeness. Dispose any questionable pieces to avoid female fruit flies from laying their eggs on these surfaces.<\/li><li><strong>Clean all surfaces.<\/strong> Thoroughly wipe down all countertops. If you don\u2019t, these spots become the perfect place for fruit flies to breed.<\/li><li><strong>Take out garbage regularly. <\/strong>This might seem like a no-brainer, but a clean house is a pest-free house. Taking out the trash will prevent bugs from lingering. <br><\/li><li><strong>Clean your drain.<\/strong> Keep sink drains free of food particles and residue as best you can.<\/li><\/ul><h3 class=\"body-h3\"><strong>Step 2: Set a trap.<strong><\/strong><\/strong><\/h3><p>Since fruit flies are drawn to rotting fruit, says Dr. Stevison, \u201cvinegar, a byproduct of the fermentation process, sets a perfect trap. Apple cider vinegar is probably best, but in a bind, beer or wine will work well, too!\u201d <br><\/p><ul><\/ul><h3 class=\"body-h3\"><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar and Dish Soap Trap<\/strong><\/h3><p class=\"body-text\"><\/p><figure><img alt=\"a woman holding a bottle of dish detergent in her hand\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_country_living_372\/7b98404ac6a448173d9bcfe2ea27f889\" data-uuid=\"16925452-2c9c-3a84-9ec5-94f5dc36cf29\"><figcaption><span class=\"photo-credit\">Robin Gentry <\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p><\/p><p class=\"body-text\">This is Dr. Stevison\u2019s recommended method.

For the container, she advises something with a narrow opening and wide base\u2014think an empty soda or beer bottle. No empty bottles on hand? Cover a casserole dish with plastic wrap and make small openings in the top to create entrances to the trap. \u201cLeave it open, or even add a funnel, and watch the flies come to you,\u201d she says. <\/p><h3 class=\"body-h3\"><strong>Apple Cider Vinegar and Plastic Wrap Trap<\/strong><br><\/h3><figure><img alt=\"Apple Cider Vinegar\" src=\"https:\/\/media.zenfs.com\/en\/aol_country_living_372\/1a8c40175ca88a4684b0f9ba4f8c4cdf\" data-uuid=\"24125434-81f3-39fe-9557-e545e85418aa\"><figcaption><span class=\"photo-credit\">jayk7 - Getty Images<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Fill a bowl or glass with <a href=\"https:\/\/go.redirectingat.com?id=74968X1596630&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FBragg-Apple-Cider-Vinegar-Raw-Unfiltered-and-Unpasteurized-16-fl-oz%2F25516475&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.countryliving.com%2Fhome-maintenance%2Fcleaning%2Fa27284947%2Fhow-to-get-rid-of-fruit-flies%2F\" target=\"_blank\">apple cider vinegar<\/a>, cover with plastic wrap, seal the edges with a rubber band, and poke tiny holes in the top.

The population <em>will<\/em> dwindle once temperatures cool off, but while you can wait them out, there are two reasons not to: (1) They can transfer bacteria. (2) Remember what we learned about diapause, that hibernation-like state in which fruit flies can survive a long time at low temperatures. <\/p><h2 class=\"body-h2\">What\u2019s the difference between fruit flies and gnats? <\/h2><p>If you spot little black bugs flying around, the first thing you want to do is identify the bug. It\u2019s easy to confuse fruit flies and fungus gnats, a common lookalike. Gnats tend to be gray or black, while fruit flies range from light tan to reddish orange and brown. Fruit flies have a taste for too-ripe fruit and other produce and thrive on high-fructose substances. Fungus gnats, on the other hand, live in soils and on plants, so if you think you\u2019re spotting those, the issue may not be in your fruit bowl. <\/p>\n<p><strong>You Might Also Like<\/strong><\/p><ul><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.countryliving.com\/home-design\/g1887\/tiny-house\/?utm_medium=syn&amp;utm_source=yah&amp;utm_campaign=55\">70 Impressive Tiny Houses That Maximize Function and Style<\/a><\/li><li><a href=\"https:\/\/www.countryliving.com\/home-design\/decorating-ideas\/advice\/g1704\/kitchen-paint-color-ideas\/?utm_medium=syn&amp;utm_source=yah&amp;utm_campaign=55\">30+ Paint Colors That Will Instantly Transform Your Kitchen<\/a><\/li><\/ul>",

Some people also have headaches; Embiid said he had those, and he&#39;s also said he&#39;s bothered by eye dryness and uses drops for it.<\/p>\n<p>When your face is drooping on one side, it&#39;s easy to think you&#39;re having a stroke\u2014facial drooping is one hallmark of a stroke (along with red flags that make up the acronym <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.strokeawareness.com\/\">BE FAST<\/a>\u2014Balance loss, Eyesight changes, Facial drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulty or slurring). This is a case where you definitely don&#39;t want to self-diagnose.

But it still takes a while\u2014a few weeks to about six months\u2014to recover. Occasionally, according to the NINDS, facial function won&#39;t fully recover.

        "description": "<p>If you\u2019re following rates on certificates of deposit, you probably know that you can get around 5% APY from most major banks and digital accounts \u2014 which isn\u2019t a bad deal for a guaranteed investment. Yes, you could put that money into the stock market and hope for a higher return. But given the past few years of market volatility and the current stresses of elections and recessions, it could make sense to choose the guaranteed option.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s what we did, after all. Our household \u2014 that is to say, myself and the Gentleman of the House \u2014 took our money out of the stock market years ago, recognizing that the record highs might not return for some time. With the goal of maximizing compound interest while avoiding market risk, we started putting our cash in 5% APY CDs and 4.5% APY <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/best-high-yield-interest-savings-accounts-143228271.html\">high-yield savings accounts<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>I\u2019m not a professional investment advisor, but I have been writing about personal finance for over a decade. I\u2019m also fairly good at math, so I know that the difference between putting $50,000 in a 4.5% APY savings account for five years and locking it into a 5% APY CD for the same amount of time is a little more than $1,500. We\u2019d end the five-year period with $63,814.08 in the CD and $62,309.10 in the savings account, assuming annual compounding \u2014 and, of course, assuming the interest rate on our savings account didn\u2019t change.<\/p>\n<p>That\u2019s why we\u2019re keeping two years\u2019 worth of expenses in cash \u2014 the risk of breaking the CD and taking the penalty isn\u2019t worth the extra $1,500 we might earn if we were able to go five years without accessing our emergency fund.<\/p>\n<div id=\"c0fd9e1b4b7d46d59876ffa3fd81e40b\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/flo.uri.sh\/visualisation\/17718169\/embed?auto=1\" title=\"Interactive or visual content\" class=\"flourish-embed-iframe\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"width:100%;height:600px;\" sandbox=\"allow-same-origin allow-scripts\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>At this point you\u2019re probably thinking two things: First, that you might not have two years\u2019 worth of expenses in cash; and second, that there are a handful of 5% APY CDs from reputable banks that currently only require a 10-month commitment.<\/p>\n<p>Does that mean you should invest in a certificate of deposit?<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-every-cd-has-a-breakeven-point\">Every CD has a breakeven point<\/h2>\n<p>Whether you should invest in a CD comes down to whether you anticipate breaking the CD \u2014 and whether you can do enough math to calculate the breakeven point.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, if you don\u2019t have at least six months\u2019 worth of expenses in cash, don\u2019t mess around with CDs. Stick your money in a HYSA and keep building your e-fund.<\/p>\n<p>But let\u2019s say you\u2019ve got enough of an emergency fund to cover your household during a period of lower-than-usual income or higher-than-usual expenses. Let\u2019s also say that you\u2019re up to date on your tax-advantaged retirement savings, including health savings accounts. At that point, you can consider putting your extra cash into one of those 10-month 5% APY CDs, assuming they\u2019re still available \u2014 and you probably won\u2019t even need to worry about the breakeven point, since the odds that you\u2019ll spend down your six-month e-fund in the 10 months before your CD matures are extremely small.<\/p>\n<p>That said, I know there are people who are going to put a portion of their emergency fund into a CD under the assumption that they can make it 10 months (or five years) without needing the cash. I also know that some of those people will ask themselves, five months down the road, whether they should break their CD.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re dealing with a for-real emergency, in which the necessity of accessing cash immediately outweighs all other possibilities, obviously you\u2019re going to break the CD and take the penalty. (I\u2019ve broken a CD before, when I was younger and less skilled at anticipating my financial future. It\u2019s not the end of the world.)<\/p>\n<p>But if you\u2019re considering breaking the CD versus some other option, such as taking out a credit card with a 15-month 0% intro APR and covering the expense that way, it\u2019s worth knowing whether you\u2019ll break even on the broken CD.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Dig deeper:<\/strong> <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/high-yield-savings-account-vs-cd-145322422.html\">High-yield savings account vs. CD: What to know when rates are high<\/a><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-early-withdrawal-penalties--and-where-to-find-them\">Early withdrawal penalties \u2014 and where to find them<\/h2>\n<p>Banks are required by the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/files.consumerfinance.gov\/f\/documents\/102012_cfpb_truth-savings-act-tisa_procedures.pdf\">Truth in Savings Act<\/a> to provide information on the various penalties for CD early withdrawals, although you may have to dig through the fine print to find them. In most cases, you will owe a certain amount of interest back to the bank regardless of how much interest your CD has earned prior to the withdrawal. This means that if you break a CD too early, you\u2019ll end up paying a portion of your initial deposit to the bank.<\/p>\n<p>How much you\u2019ll have to pay depends on the bank, the account and the fine print around interest.<\/p>\n<p>If you take out a Capital One 360 CD at 5.10% APY for 10 months, for example, you\u2019ll owe three months\u2019 interest back to Capital One if you break the CD early.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2024-04\/85202720-033d-11ef-affd-b0c4246fd4c0\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2024-04\/85202720-033d-11ef-affd-b0c4246fd4c0\" style=\"height:396px;width:2282px;\" alt=\"Capital One 360 CD early withdrawal penalty\" data-uuid=\"37da1645-1e4f-302d-a440-2697ecfb29ad\"\/><figcaption>Terms and conditions: Capital One 360 CD<\/figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Screenshot<\/div><\/figure>\n<p>This means that the breakeven point on this particular CD is three months long. If you can make it more than three months without breaking the CD, you\u2019ll earn money. If you break the CD before three months are up, you\u2019ll lose money.<\/p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you take out a Synchrony Bank CD at 5.25% APY for 9 months, you\u2019ll only owe 90 days of simple interest if you withdraw early.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2024-04\/a87cb3b0-034b-11ef-bfb7-bcc22171322c\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2024-04\/a87cb3b0-034b-11ef-bfb7-bcc22171322c\" style=\"height:228px;width:1412px;\" alt=\"Synchrony Bank\" data-uuid=\"e3b6d820-67d2-3bc6-b1f7-fff944d85bba\"\/><figcaption>Terms and conditions: Synchrony Bank CD<\/figcaption><div class=\"photo-credit\">Synchrony Bank<\/div><\/figure>\n<p>Simple interest is the opposite of compound interest, and it\u2019s calculated based only on the principal deposit. The math gets a bit more complicated here, and it\u2019s probably easiest for me to tell you to just wait 90 days before breaking the CD, but there is a scenario in which you could come out ahead a little earlier. Synchrony Bank also lets you withdraw the interest from your CD at any time without penalty \u2014 which, depending on how much you deposit, could help you cover an unexpected expense without too much extra cost.<\/p>\n<p>Look for early withdrawal details and penalties in your CD\u2019s terms, conditions and disclosures to help you decide whether a particular CD is worth it.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s also worth taking the time to consider your financial situation and whether you\u2019re going to need the money before it matures. If you\u2019re at all concerned that you might need to break your CD before the breakeven date, don\u2019t make the deposit. Keep the money in a high-yield savings account and focus on other income-building strategies.<\/p>\n<p>Spending less is always an option, but I prefer strategies and tactics that allow you to improve your skills and earn more money \u2014 which, in many cases, outperforms even the best guaranteed return.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Related reading:<\/strong> <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/what-is-a-cd-ladder-144016510.html\">What is a CD ladder?

Unlike a traditional savings account, a certificate of deposit holds your money for a fixed period of time \u2014 terms of one month to five years or longer \u2014 paying out the interest your deposit amount earns only after the term expires or &quot;matures.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Typical CD rates are fixed, which means you&#39;re guaranteed a rate of return that doesn&#39;t change. While you can&#39;t add to or access your cash until the CD matures, the trade-off is a safe, stable way to earn a much higher yield than you&#39;d find with a traditional savings account.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-compare-cds\">How to compare CDs<\/h2>\n<p>When choosing the best certificate of deposit for your budget, compare these key factors against your specific savings or financial goals.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Term length. <\/strong>A CD is ideal for saving toward a specific goal with money you\u2019re not likely to need until the account matures. Look to shorter terms for saving toward, say, a family holiday or new appliances. Terms of one to five years or longer can help you lock in today\u2019s highest APYs before interest rates are expected to drop.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Rate of return. <\/strong>Look for the highest APY for the term you\u2019re interested in. The APY is the amount of interest the CD earns in a year \u2014 including compounding. Unlike a savings account, CD rates are fixed, meaning they won\u2019t change over your term.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Minimum deposit. <\/strong>While you can find CDs without minimum starting deposits, most CDs require $100 to $1,000 to open an account. Generally, if you have the money for a higher initial deposit, you can earn a higher APY \u2014 just be sure that amount isn\u2019t a hardship on your budget.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Type of bank or financial institution. <\/strong>Today\u2019s best interest rates are offered by digital banks, with few exceptions among traditional brick-and-mortar banks or credit unions. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with an online-only bank, look to a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/high-yield-savings-account-vs-money-market-account-152354393.html\">high-yield savings account or money market account<\/a> offering a high rate without withdrawal penalties.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Penalties and fees. <\/strong>Life happens, and you might find yourself needing to tap into your money before the CD matures. Early withdrawal penalties are typically expressed in months of interest you\u2019re giving up \u2014 for example, 90 days of interest for CD terms of up to 24 months. Often the longer the term, the higher the penalty fee.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-benefits-of-a-certificate-of-deposit\">Benefits of a certificate of deposit<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Guaranteed returns. <\/strong>With a CD, you make one deposit and earn a guaranteed interest rate over your term that\u2019s yours after the CD matures.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Higher rates than traditional accounts.<\/strong> Many banks and financial institutions offer CDs at rates that are higher than you\u2019ll earn with the average savings or money market account \u2014 with digital and online banks offering the highest rates on average.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Range of CD terms.<\/strong> You can find CD terms of three months to five years or more to fit your financial goals. Rates for six-month CDs can outpace the average bank account, and longer terms offer rates comparable to the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/best-high-yield-interest-savings-accounts-143228271.html\">best high-yield savings accounts<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-drawbacks-of-a-certificate-of-a-deposit\">Drawbacks of a certificate of a deposit<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Penalty for early withdrawals.<\/strong> If you need to access your money before your CD term expires, you face fees equal to several months of interest \u2014 as much as three to six months\u2019 worth, depending on the account.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Not the highest investment returns.<\/strong> CDs are a safe way to steadily earn interest, but you stand to earn more over the long term through stocks, bonds or securities. And by locking your money in a CD, you could miss out if average rates increase.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>You can\u2019t add more money. <\/strong>After your CD locks, you aren\u2019t able to add to your balance until after the CD matures \u2014 at which point, you can move your money to another account or roll it over to a new CD.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-alternatives-to-a-certificate-of-deposit\">Alternatives to a certificate of deposit<\/h2>\n<p>A certificate of deposit isn\u2019t the only low-risk way to earn interest on your savings.

Compare <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/high-yield-savings-account-vs-cd-145322422.html\">how CDs and HYSAs differ<\/a> in access, flexibility and type of interest earned before deciding on the best for your investment.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-banks-make-money-with-a-cd\">How do banks make money with a CD?<\/h3>\n<p>Banks charge higher interest rates on money they lend out than the interest they pay on customer deposit accounts. The difference is called a spread, and it\u2019s what banks rely on to make money. Unlike a traditional savings account that allows for flexible movement of your money without penalty, a CD requires you to lock in your deposit over a specified period of time, returning your principal plus interest after the account matures. That lock-in period \u2014 and penalties that discourage your early withdrawal \u2014 allows a bank to better plan how long it has to make money off your deposit, and it\u2019s typically willing to pay a little more for that reliability.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-my-money-safe-with-a-fintech-like-lending-club-or-sofi\">Is my money safe with a fintech like Lending Club or SoFi?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes. Financial technology companies \u2014 or fintechs \u2014 partner with FDIC-insured banks to offer deposit accounts that are protected by the government for up to $250,000. The FDIC insures the safety of your money, even if the fintech were to fail or go out of business.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-compound-interest\">What is compound interest?<\/h3>\n<p>Compound interest is often described as earning interest on your interest. It\u2019s a powerful way to boost your savings over time by earning interest on both your initial deposit <em>and<\/em> any interest you earn along the way. An account&#39;s APY is the total amount of interest you&#39;ll earn on your deposit over one year, including compound interest, expressed as a percentage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-a-no-penalty-cd\">What is a no-penalty CD?<\/h3>\n<p>A no-penalty CD \u2014 also called a liquid CD \u2014 is like a traditional CD through which you lock in a deposit for a guaranteed rate of return over a stated period of time, but with the flexibility of withdrawing your money without penalty before the CD matures. This flexibility comes with trade-offs, however, including lower rates of return than a traditional CD. With rates at historic highs, a high-yield savings account may offer comparable or even higher rates than a no-penalty CD with the same flexibility.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-a-cd-ladder\">What is a CD ladder?<\/h3>\n<p>A CD ladder is a savings strategy designed to spread out your money across multiple CDs to leverage high rates without tying up your full investment into one long-term CD. The result of CD laddering is access to a portion of your investment at regular, timed intervals. With rates at all-time highs, a short-term CD ladder combines the high rates of return of a long-term CD with the flexible access to your money that a shorter-term CD offers.<\/p>\n<p>Learn how <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/what-is-a-cd-ladder-144016510.html\">a short-term CD ladder<\/a> can help you lock in today&#39;s highest rates while enjoying rolling returns \u2014 before rates drop.<\/p>\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: Annual percentage yields shown are as of Friday, April 26, at 7:50 a.m. ET.

The settlement isn\u2019t expected to affect mortgage rates, yet it paves the way for consumers to negotiate what they pay for an agent\u2019s services, potentially saving money in the long run.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-4-top-factors-that-affect-your-mortgage-rate\">4 top factors that affect your mortgage rate<\/h2>\n<p>The difference of even half a percentage point on your interest rate can save you hundreds of dollars a month and thousands of dollars over the life of your mortgage, but the mortgage rate you&#39;re ultimately offered depends on the mortgage you&#39;re interested in, payments you&#39;re willing to pay up front and your overall financial health.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Your credit score.<\/strong> Knowing your credit score can help you shop around for lenders you&#39;re likely to get approval through, as well as understand the type of mortgage for your lifestyle and income. The best mortgage rates go to borrowers with good to excellent credit \u2014 typically a FICO credit score of at least 670 \u2014 though even with fair credit, you may be able to find a mortgage offering decent rates.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Your down payment. <\/strong>The more money you can put down toward your home, the better it benefits your interest rate. Paying at least 20% of your home&#39;s purchase price up front generally results in a lower interest rate \u2014 <em>and <\/em>you can avoid mortgage insurance, which increases your total cost.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Your loan term. <\/strong>While the 30-year mortgage remains a popular way for Americans to purchase homes, you can find terms of 20 years, 15 years and 10 years. Shorter loan terms usually come with lower interest rates, though with higher monthly payments. Longer mortgage terms can result in smaller monthly payments, though you&#39;ll pay higher total interest over the life of your loan.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Interest rate type. <\/strong>Mortgage rates come with two basic types of rates \u2014 fixed and variable. Fixed-rate mortgages offer a consistent interest rate over the life of your loan, whereas adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) often start with a lower fixed rate for an agreed-on time and then adjust to a variable rate based on market conditions for the remainder of your term. Choosing between these two rates depends on your financial goals and tolerance for risk.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-frequently-asked-questions-about-mortgage-rates\">Frequently asked questions about mortgage rates<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-are-mortgage-lenders\"><strong>What are mortgage lenders? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Lenders are financial institutions that loan money to homebuyers. A lender is different from a loan servicer, which typically handles the operational tasks of your loan, like processing payments, talking directly with borrowers and sending monthly statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-does-it-mean-to-refinance-a-mortgage\"><strong>What does it mean to refinance a mortgage?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>Refinancing is a process of trading in your current mortgage to another lender for lower rates and better terms than your current loan. With a refinance, the new lender pays off your old mortgage and you then pay your monthly statements from the new lender.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-factors-influence-mortgage-rates\"><strong>What factors influence mortgage rates? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Mortgage rates are determined by many factors that include inflation rates, economic conditions, housing market trends and the Federal Reserve&#39;s target interest rate. Lenders also consider your personal credit score, the amount available for your down payment, the property you&#39;re interested in and other terms of the loan you&#39;re requesting, like 30-year or 15-year offers.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-when-is-the-best-time-to-lock-in-a-mortgage-rate\"><strong>When is the best time to lock in a mortgage rate? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Mortgage rates can fluctuate daily, so it&#39;s best to lock in a rate when you&#39;re comfortable with the offered rate and conditions of the loan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-why-are-mortgage-rates-so-high\">Why are mortgage rates so high?<\/h3>\n<p>Mortgage rates are influenced by complicated factors like inflation, employment rates, the bond market and the overall economy. While the Federal Reserve doesn&#39;t set mortgage rates, this central bank of the U.S. sets benchmark rates that indirectly affect rates on financial products like mortgages, personal loans and deposit accounts.<\/p>\n<p>March inflation data came in higher than expectations, which is among the main concerns driving mortgage rates higher in April.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-i-negotiate-my-mortgage-rate\"><strong>Can I negotiate my mortgage rate? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It&#39;s not likely \u2014 lenders consider the market conditions and other financial factors when determining rates. You can, however, ask about how you can reduce costs in other ways when comparing mortgage lenders. For instance, many lenders offer lower rates in exchange for &quot;mortgage points&quot; \u2014 upfront fees you pay to your lender. A mortgage point could cost 1% of your mortgage amount, which means about $5,000 on a $500,000 home loan, with each point lowering your interest rate by about 0.25%, depending on your lender and loan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"37734d4905894e2dabe503c5246897a4\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.myfinance.com\/as\/380044bc-da8a-4c87-ba55-7cfd4559b93f?utm_medium=embed&amp;imr=https:\/\/www.aol.com\/&amp;utm_campaign=aolsyndication-heloc-multi&amp;subId=PLACEVUIDHERE\" class=\"myFinance-iframe\" title=\"Advertisement\" id=\"myfiWidget_5\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: Annual percentage yields shown are as of Friday, April 26, 2024, at 7:40 a.m. ET.

Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called core prices held at 3.8 percent in March.<\/p>\n<p>The latest figures suggest that slowing inflation is now losing some momentum. Inflation hasn\u2019t improved for 10 months, when the annual rate hit 3 percent for the first time in June 2023. Core prices have also begun moving sideways, barely improving from the 4 percent level they officially reached four months ago in October.<\/p>\n<p>Taken together, however, inflation is still well below its peak in June 2022, when it smashed 9.1 percent.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-prices-that-are-rising-the-most\">Prices that are rising the most<\/h3>\n<p>Of the nearly 400 items that BLS tracks, more than 2 in 3 (or 67 percent) increased in price between March 2023 and 2024. Almost half (49 percent) picked up speed from the prior 12-month period and rose faster than the Fed\u2019s preferred 2 percent target (45 percent).<\/p>\n<p>According to BLS, these are the prices that increased most over the past year \u2014 from March 2023 to March 2024:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Video discs and other media*: <\/strong>30.1%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Frozen noncarbonated juices and drinks*: <\/strong>27.5%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Motor vehicle insurance: <\/strong>22.2%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Repair of household items*:<\/strong> 18%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Care of the sick and elderly at home*:<\/strong> 14.2%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Motor vehicle repair: <\/strong>11.6%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Uncooked beef roasts:<\/strong> 11.2%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Domestic services*:<\/strong> 10.9%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Transportation services:<\/strong> 10.7%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Baby food and formula*:<\/strong> 9.9%<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>*Denotes an item that isn\u2019t seasonally adjusted<\/em><\/p>\n<p>Month-over-month price changes can also give consumers a more real-time look at the prices that have recently been popping, though consumers should take seasonal variations into account. BLS doesn\u2019t seasonally adjust all of its items, and year-over-year inflation rates can better smooth out those variations.<\/p>\n<p>According to BLS, these are the prices that increased most over the past month from February 2024 to March 2024:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Video discs and other media*: <\/strong>14.7%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Care of the sick and elderly at home*:<\/strong> 5.9%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Girls&#39; apparel:<\/strong> 5.9%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Lettuce: <\/strong>5.9%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Eggs: <\/strong>4.6%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Recreational books*: <\/strong>4.5%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Purchase, subscription and rental of video*:<\/strong> 3.8%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Pork chops:<\/strong> 3.3%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Motor vehicle repair:<\/strong> 3.1%<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Other pork, including roasts, steaks and ribs:<\/strong> 3%<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><em>*Denotes an item that isn\u2019t seasonally adjusted<\/em><\/p>\n<h2 id=\"why-is-inflation-so-high-right-now\">Why is inflation so high right now?<\/h2>\n<p>Consumers might look at the massive 30.1 percent increase in video discs and other media \u2014 the largest increase ever \u2014 and wonder why the overall inflation rate is just 3.5 percent. To put it simply, the Bureau of Labor Statistics assigns weights to each individual good or service it tracks, based on how prevalent it\u2019s considered to be in a consumer\u2019s monthly budget.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, the largest contributors to inflation are shelter, motor vehicle insurance and energy.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Taken together, energy and shelter were responsible for more than half of the monthly 0.4 percent increase in prices between February and March 2024, BLS said.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Over the past 12 months, shelter has accounted for more than half (56 percent) of the increase in prices. Put another way, if shelter had remained stable, prices would have only risen 1.5 percent from a year ago.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Over the past 12 months, inflation would have risen just 2.9 percent had motor vehicle insurance costs remained stable.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The drivers of inflation have changed dramatically since the initial post-pandemic price burst. When price pressures peaked in June 2022, shelter was driving just 20 percent of the annual increase in prices. But as consumers emerged from lockdowns with massive pent-up demand at the same time as global supply shortages, energy was driving about a third (32 percent) of inflation, while food prices were driving 15 percent of inflation.<\/p>\n<p>The changing drivers of inflation have evolved as much as the U.S. economy. Supply chains have untangled since the pandemic, helping take the pressure off of goods inflation. However, services such as rent, insurance and even the price of dining out can take months, if not years, to fluctuate \u2014 depending on what\u2019s happening with labor costs and consumer spending.<\/p>\n<p>To combat inflation, officials on the Federal Reserve have lifted borrowing costs from a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/banking\/federal-reserve\/history-of-federal-funds-rate\/?_bypasscdn=c45e41b3-c56e-40b2-a707-06a6256294cc&amp;mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication#1991\">rock-bottom level<\/a> of near-zero percent to a 23-year high of 5.25-5.5 percent.

At their peak, grocery prices soared 13.5 percent in July 2022 from a year ago.Of the major shopping categories:Meanwhile, the price of dining out (formally known as full service meals and snacks) jumped 4.2 percent from a year ago, capping off a 25.8 percent increase since the pandemic.<\/p><ul>\n<li><p>Meats: up 3.4 percent over the past year and 26.5 percent since February 2020<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Fish and seafood: down 2.6 percent from a year ago but still up 16 percent since the start of the pandemic-induced recession<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Dairy: down 1.9 percent over the past year but still 18.9 percent more expensive since the pandemic<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Fruits and vegetables: up 2 percent over the past year but 18.2 percent more expensive than before the pandemic<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p>Sugar and sweets: up 4.3 percent from a year ago and 28 percent since the pandemic<br><\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Rent. <\/strong>Rent has become one of the most costly categories of a consumer\u2019s budget.Rent of primary residence in March jumped 5.7 percent from a year ago, BLS data shows. To be sure, rent prices aren\u2019t rising as quickly as they once were, at one point surging 8.8 percent over a 12-month period back in March and April 2023. Yet, Americans who\u2019ve had to sign new leases since the outbreak are feeling the pinch: Rent is up 22.6 percent since the pandemic.Real-time measures show that rents aren\u2019t rising as quickly as they were at the height of post-pandemic lockdowns, though a sharper slowdown hasn\u2019t yet been reflected in the official BLS monthly report. One reason could be because of lags, even longer than usual for shelter prices as leases and housing agreements take longer to roll over from the previous year. Another could simply be because <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/real-estate\/home-affordability-in-current-housing-market-study\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">homes have stayed pricey<\/a>, keeping more renters on the sidelines than usual.<br><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Vacations. <\/strong>Inflation hasn\u2019t just made the prices of key household essentials \u2014 but the costs of vacations and travel, too.

But officially, they prefer a different measure to see whether they\u2019re succeeding at controlling inflation: the Department of Commerce\u2019s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index.<\/p>\n<p>But that preference has been keeping Fed watchers on their toes. Lately, the PCE index has been indicating slower inflation, with overall prices just half a percentage point above the Fed\u2019s target \u2014 compared to a hotter 1.5 percentage points as shown with CPI.<\/p>\n<p>Those variations have always been afoot. Mainly, they\u2019re because of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bls.gov\/opub\/btn\/archive\/differences-between-the-consumer-price-index-and-the-personal-consumption-expenditures-price-index.pdf?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">methodology differences<\/a>. For starters, PCE takes consumers\u2019 substitutions into account (for example, one family\u2019s decision to buy fish over meat for one month because it\u2019s cheaper).<\/p>\n<p>But another key difference is to blame lately. Both agencies estimate an item\u2019s relative importance differently, with BLS\u2019 gauge giving the most weight to the category of inflation that\u2019s coincidentally been the hottest: shelter.<\/p>\n<p>For Fed officials, the story remains largely the same: Inflation is slowing but still stubbornly above their 2 percent goalpost. Yet, when officials do decide to change policy \u2014 including <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/banking\/federal-reserve\/when-will-fed-cut-rates\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">cutting interest rates<\/a> \u2014 the variations could make the decision trickier. Fed officials don\u2019t want to risk cutting interest rates too soon, for fear that it could stoke even higher inflation if it causes demand to rise again.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhile this report is not what the Fed wants to see, most of the inflationary gains are concentrated in housing and car insurance, sectors that are expected to calm down eventually,\u201d says Tuan Nguyen, U.S. economist at RSM. \u201cIt\u2019s reasonable to expect that inflation could start going down again in the next month or two.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"takeaways-for-consumers\">Takeaways for consumers<\/h2>\n<p>For consumers, the message is clear: Inflation has cooled dramatically since peaking in the summer of 2022, though it remains undefeated.

If it is, the Fed might need to slow the financial system down more to finish the job, ultimately risking consumers\u2019 paychecks and employment if it dents the robust job market.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Expect higher-for-longer rates from the Fed: <\/strong>Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that officials need to cut interest rates long before prices hit 2 percent on an annual basis. If they don\u2019t, they risk slowing the economy down too much for too long.

They also must obtain written authorization from law enforcement, he noted.<\/p><p>&quot;There are folks across the state who disagree on the way forward,&quot; Lee said Thursday, adding that he thought the legislation would allow school districts the opportunity to decide &quot;at the local level what is best for the schools and the children in that district.&quot; <\/p><p>But the measure drew criticism from Democrats like state Rep. Bo Mitchell, who referred to the Covenant shooting in remarks on the House floor.<\/p><p>\u201cThis is what we\u2019re going to do.

Smith asked back in December for the court to decide the issue swiftly \u2014 at a time when Trump\u2019s trial was scheduled for March.<\/p>\n<p>The justices instead let the process play out at its regular speed \u2014 an advantage for Trump.<\/p>\n<p>Less advantageous to the former president are the proceedings in New York, where reporters in the court say he has sometimes seemed exasperated to have to sit through the re-airing of allegations of lurid personal conduct.<\/p>\n<p>Here are the main takeaways from the two proceedings<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A good day for Trump at the Supreme Court<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The Supreme Court hearing, the more important matter Thursday, broadly went Trump\u2019s way.<\/p>\n<p>The only negative for Trump was that the justices appeared skeptical of the broadest argument made by his team \u2014 that a president or ex-president enjoys virtually unlimited criminal immunity for any action committed in office.<\/p>\n<p>But against that, several of the court\u2019s six conservative justices appeared eager to draw a distinction between \u201cofficial\u201d acts and \u201cprivate\u201d acts \u2014 and seemed inclined to offer the president protection from prosecution for the former, at least.<\/p>\n<p>They pressed the Department of Justice\u2019s lawyer Michael Dreeben hard on whether past presidents could, hypothetically, have been prosecuted for specific acts taken while in office.<\/p>\n<p>Justice Samuel Alito asked whether former President Franklin D. Roosevelt could have been prosecuted for infringing the civil rights of Japanese Americans by interning them during World War II. \u201cToday, yes,\u201d Dreeben responded.<\/p>\n<p>Justice Clarence Thomas drew a similar hypothetical over Operation Mongoose, a clandestine CIA-led effort in the early 1960s to depose the Cuban government led by Fidel Castro.<\/p>\n<p>The general tenor of the conservatives\u2019 arguments drew implicit rebukes from their liberal colleagues.<\/p>\n<p>Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson asked John Sauer, representing Trump, \u201cWhy is it that the president would not be required to follow the law when he is performing his official acts?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Justice Sonia Sotomayor complained that the principle that no one is above the law \u201cin his official or private acts\u201d has \u201cbeen somewhat put into suspicion here.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>But, with conservatives holding a 6-3 majority, the odds favor Trump and his team.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Time \u2014 and delay \u2014 are Trump\u2019s friends<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There was another positive for Trump in the Supreme Court hearing.<\/p>\n<p>The apparent willingness of the conservative justices to emphasize a distinction between private and official acts opens the door to further delay in the underlying trial on Jan. 6-related charges.<\/p>\n<p>Two of the three justices Trump appointed during his term \u2014 Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh \u2014 suggested that more hearings could be required to adjudicate the distinction when it comes to the specific charges in the former president\u2019s indictment.<\/p>\n<p>Trump wants to kick as many of the trials as possible past the date of the presidential election.<\/p>\n<p>If Trump were to win the presidency for a second time, he could order the Department of Justice to drop any federal cases against him.<\/p>\n<p>Notably, he does not have that power over state cases, such as the New York hush money trial and the Georgia election probe.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>But Trump\u2019s legal team made some startling claims<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Under questioning from Sotomayor, Trump\u2019s lawyer made some startling arguments.<\/p>\n<p>The most striking of all was to suggest that a president could enjoy criminal immunity for killing a rival.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Sotomayor laid out the hypothetical where \u201cthe president decides that his rival is a corrupt person and he orders the military, or orders someone, to assassinate him.\u201d She then asked, \u201cIs that within his official acts for which he can get immunity?\u201d<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIt would depend on the hypothetical,\u201d Sauer responded before adding that it \u201ccould well be an official act.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The suggestion caused instant uproar on social media and was met with immediate condemnation from some quarters.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnderstand what the Trump team is arguing here,\u201d Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) wrote on social media. \u201cTake it seriously and at face value. This is not a game.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>In New York, a clash with Trump rallies<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>In New York, ongoing legal battles continue over whether Trump violated a gag order in social media posts that have attacked various adversaries.<\/p>\n<p>Prosecutors are arguing that the former president has violated the gag order 10 times, and they want the court to levy a $1,000 fine in each instance. Trump\u2019s team has contended he is simply responding to claims made by others.<\/p>\n<p>Judge Juan Merchan has scheduled another court date on the matter for Wednesday \u2014 typically the day off from trial proceedings in the case.<\/p>\n<p>The complication is Trump has rallies scheduled for that day in Wisconsin and Michigan.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s the most direct example yet of how the legal cases are intersecting with Trump\u2019s efforts to win back the White House.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>An unusual warmth toward a damaging witness<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>The first week of actual trial proceedings in New York has been dominated by former magazine executive David Pecker.<\/p>\n<p>Pecker has outlined how the National Enquirer, the tabloid of which he was previously publisher, bought stories that could have been damaging to Trump with the intention of quashing them.<\/p>\n<p>There seems little doubt that Pecker\u2019s evidence has helped the prosecution more than the defense, so it was somewhat incongruous to hear Pecker say he considers Trump a \u201cmentor\u201d and for the former president to return the warmth.<\/p>\n<p>The quick-to-anger Trump called Pecker a \u201cnice guy,\u201d leaving some observers scratching their heads.<\/p>\n<p><a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/thehill.com\/\">\t\t\t\tFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill. \t\t\t\t<\/a><\/p>",

You might call it an <em>endless kind of love<\/em> and that turns out to be a problem for Red Lobster. The fast-casual seafood chain is reportedly eyeing Chapter 11 bankruptcy after an endless shrimp deal proved way too popular.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>On a recent earnings call the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Red Lobster\u2019s parent company announced that its Ultimate Endless Shrimp deal, which offered diners unlimited shrimp and a side of Red Lobster&#39;s famous Cheddar Bay Biscuits for just $20, was a massive hit. That is a good thing, of course, but turns out it was too much of a good thing. As <em>Good Morning America<\/em><a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.goodmorningamerica.com\/food\/story\/red-lobster-eyes-bankruptcy-option-after-11m-losses-109376206\">reported<\/a>, the Florida-based restaurant chain reportedly is posting an operating loss of more than $11 million in the third quarter of 2023 and a further $12.5 million in losses in the fourth quarter of 2023. Those losses were due in part to folks coming in and eating as much shrimp as they could for that $20 price tag. While the offer did lure in more customers, the restaurant wasn&#39;t making enough money on the deal. &quot;We knew the price was cheap, but the idea was to bring more traffic in the restaurants,&quot; CFO Ludovic Regis Henri Garnier told investors, according to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:9;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.restaurantbusinessonline.com\/operations\/red-lobster-goes-overboard-endless-shrimp-deal#:~:text=But%20the%20deal%20turned%20out,Shrimp%20as%20a%20key%20factor.\"><em>Restaurant Business<\/em><\/a>. &quot;So we wanted to boost our traffic, and it didn&#39;t work.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now, according to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bloomberg.com\/news\/articles\/2024-04-16\/red-lobster-mulls-filing-for-bankruptcy-to-fix-balance-sheet\"><em>Bloomberg<\/em><\/a>, the restaurant is considering filing for Chapter 11. According to Restaurant Business, the restaurant is eyeing overall losses of around $20 million. Don\u2019t worry that Red Lobster is closing just yet, though. A Chapter 11 bankruptcy would allow the chain to stay open while dealing with its debt and help the chain re-negotiate long-term contracts and real estate.<\/p>\n<p>To help shore up their finances, the company has also recognized that the $20 price tag for all-you-can-eat shrimp was far too low. So now, Red Lobster has upped the price to $25, which they hope will keep them afloat a while longer.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;For more Southern Living news, make sure to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.southernliving.com\/newsletter-opt-in-apple-news-7096248\">sign up for our newsletter!<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;Read the original article on <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.southernliving.com\/red-lobster-endless-shrimp-bankruptcy-8638679\">Southern Living<\/a>.<\/p>",

In addition, it is known that it was a good runner, which was something it needed because it lived with a large number of predators and its only defense was to be faster than them.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The dinosaur&#39;s name derives from Chaki, which is a word from the Aonikenk language, of the indigenous Tehuelche people, which means &quot;old guanaco&quot;, a reference to a medium-sized herbivore mammal found in the region. Nekul means &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;agile&quot; in the Mapudung\u00fan language, of the local Mapuche people.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;He had very strong hind limbs and a tail with an anatomy that allowed him to maneuver it to the sides and so be able to balance during races,&quot; Sebasti\u00e1n Rozadilla, co-author of the publication, explained to Reuters.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A team of Argentine paleontologists with the support of the National Geographic Society, made the discovery initially in 2018, but recently unveiled their finding in the respected journal Cretaceous Research.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(Reporting by Miguel Lo Bianco; witing by Lucila Sigal; Editing by Nicol\u00e1s Misculin and Aurora Ellis)&nbsp;<\/p>",

Would these $31 leggings compare? (Note: Prices vary between colors.)<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-first-impressions\">First impressions<\/h2>\n<p>The first thing I noticed when my leggings arrived was how thin the fabric felt \u2014 not necessarily a bad thing, seeing as thicker leggings often make me heat up. But I did wonder how they'd stack up in the compression department. I tried them on and was pleased with how effortlessly they glided over my legs. There's that buttery-smooth feeling we're all after! They also felt secure without being too snug, and 5-foot-tall me was relieved to find that they didn't bunch up at the bottom like most leggings do (I opted for the 25-inch inseam, but they also come in a 28-inch length).&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>In terms of looks, they did a good job of smoothing everything out and have a classic, clean style that'll pair well with any sports bra or workout top. I don't like the look or feel of leggings with a ton of seams, and I appreciate that the ones on these are minimal.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/shopping.yahoo.com\/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0NvbG9yZnVsa29hbGEtV29tZW5zLURyZWFtbHV4LUhpZ2gtV2Fpc3RlZC1Xb3Jrb3V0LUxlZ2dpbmdzLTI4LUluc2VhbS1GdWxsLUxlbmd0aC1QYW50cy9kcC9CMEJWOVRGUjFTLz90YWc9YW9sMDEyMy1wLXYtajYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY5N2I1YTk4LWE4ZjQtNGEzOS1hYjY2LTk0NWQ2Yzc4MDI2OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfpIVcnZm6A04IIyfMCoDgMuTMrnIMFAlNdOVq-8J4Or&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FColorfulkoala-Womens-Dreamlux-High-Waisted-Workout-Leggings-28-Inseam-Full-Length-Pants%2Fdp%2FB0BV9TFR1S%2F\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:\" data-original-link=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Colorfulkoala-Womens-Dreamlux-High-Waisted-Workout-Leggings-28-Inseam-Full-Length-Pants\/dp\/B0BV9TFR1S\/?th=1&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=yle01-p-v-3da-20&amp;ascsubtag=16ab21a4f6a311eeb0f26174c90de4e0\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2024-01\/e08e95c0-afe0-11ee-bfed-d9c4a47fb5cb\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2024-01\/e08e95c0-afe0-11ee-bfed-d9c4a47fb5cb\" style=\"height:700px;width:1200px;\" alt=\"legs wearing the leggings in black, lavender and green on a purple background\" data-uuid=\"981215f6-82a5-32ea-bf42-6ba65d4f3e0f\"><figcaption>So many cute colors \u2014 and you can buy three pairs for less than one pair of comparable Lululemon leggings.

The gray-blue hue I chose was opaque enough to keep my underwear from showing through but I can't speak to the lighter colors. (There are 16 options.)<\/p>\n<p>To start, I wore the leggings on a 3-mile walk. Since they're very lightweight, my legs felt nice and free while I strolled around \u2014 it was almost as if the leggings were a second skin. I never felt the waistband rolling down or digging in; it just stayed put the entire time.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After a successful walk, it was time to see how they fared during a Peloton ride, which involves pedaling while both seated and standing. I was impressed by how well they stayed in place, even during more intense sprints, and the thinner fabric didn't feel constricting. There was enough compression to ensure nothing spilled out, and the material also made good on its cooling promise. That said, I can't really speak to the moisture-wicking aspect since my legs don't tend to get sweaty.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-the-verdict\">The verdict<\/h2>\n<p>All in all, if you're looking for leggings that are comparable to Lululemon, <a data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:;cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/shopping.yahoo.com\/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0NvbG9yZnVsa29hbGEtV29tZW5zLURyZWFtbHV4LUhpZ2gtV2Fpc3RlZC1Xb3Jrb3V0LUxlZ2dpbmdzLTI4LUluc2VhbS1GdWxsLUxlbmd0aC1QYW50cy9kcC9CMEJWOVRGUjFTLz90YWc9YW9sMDEyMy1wLXYtajYtMjAiLCJjb250ZW50VXVpZCI6ImY5N2I1YTk4LWE4ZjQtNGEzOS1hYjY2LTk0NWQ2Yzc4MDI2OSJ9&amp;signature=AQAAAfpIVcnZm6A04IIyfMCoDgMuTMrnIMFAlNdOVq-8J4Or&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FColorfulkoala-Womens-Dreamlux-High-Waisted-Workout-Leggings-28-Inseam-Full-Length-Pants%2Fdp%2FB0BV9TFR1S%2F\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-original-link=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Colorfulkoala-Womens-Dreamlux-High-Waisted-Workout-Leggings-28-Inseam-Full-Length-Pants\/dp\/B0BV9TFR1S\/?th=1&amp;psc=1\">Colorfulkoala Dreamlux leggings<\/a> are an affordable alternative (though they're supremely comfortable in their own right).

It has that perfect, bum-covering length \u2014 it's a bit longer in the back, which creates an attractive asymmetry. It also has three-quarter sleeves that give you a nice amount of sun protection but keep you from feeling too buttoned-up. And it's made of a gauzy rayon that filters the sun while staying breathable, so you can feel as cool as you look.<\/p>\n<p>The barely-there weight ensures you won't get overheated and sweat right through it. Ordinarily, I wouldn't wear a long-sleeve blouse in the summer humidity, but this top is so lightweight that I never take it off. Its slightly see-through nature is fine: You'll either have your bathing suit on underneath, or you can wear a thin tank top or sports bra.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here's a week in the life of my cover-up: Over the weekend, I throw it on over my swimsuit or tuck the front into a pair of denim shorts. On weekdays, I need something effortless to throw on for errands, and I come right back to this blouse. I tuck it into jeans or shorts, or I wear it over leggings or bike shorts. I even wear it at night, dressing it up with jewelry.<\/p>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/shopping.yahoo.com\/rdlw?merchantId=66ea567a-c987-4c2e-a2ff-02904efde6ea&amp;siteId=us-aol&amp;pageId=1p-autolink&amp;featureId=text-link&amp;merchantName=Amazon&amp;custData=eyJzb3VyY2VOYW1lIjoiV2ViLURlc2t0b3AtVmVyaXpvbiIsImxhbmRpbmdVcmwiOiJodHRwczovL3d3dy5hbWF6b24uY29tL0Vrb3VhZXItU3VtbWVyLVdvbWVucy1Td2ltd2Vhci1CaWtpbmkvZHAvQjA3UExDWEtEOC8_dGFnPWFvbDAxMjMtcC12LWl5LTIwIiwiY29udGVudFV1aWQiOiJkYjJjOGI5Yi0yMTg0LTQ0OWQtYjNmNy0zYTU3YzdjNzRlMTIifQ&amp;signature=AQAAAf6AeGqiPQcno9fJmjIQYCsN2bdMg2RkaNMSFZsVXTDo&amp;gcReferrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FEkouaer-Summer-Womens-Swimwear-Bikini%2Fdp%2FB07PLCXKD8%2F\" class=\"rapid-with-clickid\" data-i13n=\"elm:affiliate_link;sellerN:Amazon;elmt:\" data-original-link=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ekouaer-Summer-Womens-Swimwear-Bikini\/dp\/B07PLCXKD8\/\"><figure><img src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2024-04\/9e305ca0-0255-11ef-9fff-81994d3cd7da\" data-crop-orig-src=\"https:\/\/s.yimg.com\/os\/creatr-uploaded-images\/2024-04\/9e305ca0-0255-11ef-9fff-81994d3cd7da\" style=\"height:1080px;width:1920px;\" alt=\"Models wearing Ekouaer beach coverup in white, green and pink\" data-uuid=\"ba1f3f03-89ad-3a39-bf81-d7e85a640aba\"><figcaption>This under-$25 cover-up is the epitome of smart summer style.

Unlike a traditional savings account, a certificate of deposit holds your money for a fixed period of time \u2014 terms of one month to five years or longer \u2014 paying out the interest your deposit amount earns only after the term expires or &quot;matures.&quot;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Typical CD rates are fixed, which means you&#39;re guaranteed a rate of return that doesn&#39;t change. While you can&#39;t add to or access your cash until the CD matures, the trade-off is a safe, stable way to earn a much higher yield than you&#39;d find with a traditional savings account.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-how-to-compare-cds\">How to compare CDs<\/h2>\n<p>When choosing the best certificate of deposit for your budget, compare these key factors against your specific savings or financial goals.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Term length. <\/strong>A CD is ideal for saving toward a specific goal with money you\u2019re not likely to need until the account matures. Look to shorter terms for saving toward, say, a family holiday or new appliances. Terms of one to five years or longer can help you lock in today\u2019s highest APYs before interest rates are expected to drop.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Rate of return. <\/strong>Look for the highest APY for the term you\u2019re interested in. The APY is the amount of interest the CD earns in a year \u2014 including compounding. Unlike a savings account, CD rates are fixed, meaning they won\u2019t change over your term.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Minimum deposit. <\/strong>While you can find CDs without minimum starting deposits, most CDs require $100 to $1,000 to open an account. Generally, if you have the money for a higher initial deposit, you can earn a higher APY \u2014 just be sure that amount isn\u2019t a hardship on your budget.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Type of bank or financial institution. <\/strong>Today\u2019s best interest rates are offered by digital banks, with few exceptions among traditional brick-and-mortar banks or credit unions. If you aren\u2019t comfortable with an online-only bank, look to a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:10;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/high-yield-savings-account-vs-money-market-account-152354393.html\">high-yield savings account or money market account<\/a> offering a high rate without withdrawal penalties.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Penalties and fees. <\/strong>Life happens, and you might find yourself needing to tap into your money before the CD matures. Early withdrawal penalties are typically expressed in months of interest you\u2019re giving up \u2014 for example, 90 days of interest for CD terms of up to 24 months. Often the longer the term, the higher the penalty fee.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-benefits-of-a-certificate-of-deposit\">Benefits of a certificate of deposit<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Guaranteed returns. <\/strong>With a CD, you make one deposit and earn a guaranteed interest rate over your term that\u2019s yours after the CD matures.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Higher rates than traditional accounts.<\/strong> Many banks and financial institutions offer CDs at rates that are higher than you\u2019ll earn with the average savings or money market account \u2014 with digital and online banks offering the highest rates on average.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Range of CD terms.<\/strong> You can find CD terms of three months to five years or more to fit your financial goals.

Compare <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/high-yield-savings-account-vs-cd-145322422.html\">how CDs and HYSAs differ<\/a> in access, flexibility and type of interest earned before deciding on the best for your investment.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-do-banks-make-money-with-a-cd\">How do banks make money with a CD?<\/h3>\n<p>Banks charge higher interest rates on money they lend out than the interest they pay on customer deposit accounts. The difference is called a spread, and it\u2019s what banks rely on to make money. Unlike a traditional savings account that allows for flexible movement of your money without penalty, a CD requires you to lock in your deposit over a specified period of time, returning your principal plus interest after the account matures. That lock-in period \u2014 and penalties that discourage your early withdrawal \u2014 allows a bank to better plan how long it has to make money off your deposit, and it\u2019s typically willing to pay a little more for that reliability.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-is-my-money-safe-with-a-fintech-like-lending-club-or-sofi\">Is my money safe with a fintech like Lending Club or SoFi?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes. Financial technology companies \u2014 or fintechs \u2014 partner with FDIC-insured banks to offer deposit accounts that are protected by the government for up to $250,000. The FDIC insures the safety of your money, even if the fintech were to fail or go out of business.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-compound-interest\">What is compound interest?<\/h3>\n<p>Compound interest is often described as earning interest on your interest. It\u2019s a powerful way to boost your savings over time by earning interest on both your initial deposit <em>and<\/em> any interest you earn along the way. An account&#39;s APY is the total amount of interest you&#39;ll earn on your deposit over one year, including compound interest, expressed as a percentage.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-a-no-penalty-cd\">What is a no-penalty CD?<\/h3>\n<p>A no-penalty CD \u2014 also called a liquid CD \u2014 is like a traditional CD through which you lock in a deposit for a guaranteed rate of return over a stated period of time, but with the flexibility of withdrawing your money without penalty before the CD matures. This flexibility comes with trade-offs, however, including lower rates of return than a traditional CD. With rates at historic highs, a high-yield savings account may offer comparable or even higher rates than a no-penalty CD with the same flexibility.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-is-a-cd-ladder\">What is a CD ladder?<\/h3>\n<p>A CD ladder is a savings strategy designed to spread out your money across multiple CDs to leverage high rates without tying up your full investment into one long-term CD. The result of CD laddering is access to a portion of your investment at regular, timed intervals. With rates at all-time highs, a short-term CD ladder combines the high rates of return of a long-term CD with the flexible access to your money that a shorter-term CD offers.<\/p>\n<p>Learn how <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.aol.com\/finance\/what-is-a-cd-ladder-144016510.html\">a short-term CD ladder<\/a> can help you lock in today&#39;s highest rates while enjoying rolling returns \u2014 before rates drop.<\/p>\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: Annual percentage yields shown are as of Thursday, April 25, at 7:50 a.m. ET.

The best mortgage rates go to borrowers with good to excellent credit \u2014 typically a FICO credit score of at least 670 \u2014 though even with fair credit, you may be able to find a mortgage offering decent rates.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Your down payment. <\/strong>The more money you can put down toward your home, the better it benefits your interest rate. Paying at least 20% of your home&#39;s purchase price up front generally results in a lower interest rate \u2014 <em>and <\/em>you can avoid mortgage insurance, which increases your total cost.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Your loan term. <\/strong>While the 30-year mortgage remains a popular way for Americans to purchase homes, you can find terms of 20 years, 15 years and 10 years. Shorter loan terms usually come with lower interest rates, though with higher monthly payments. Longer mortgage terms can result in smaller monthly payments, though you&#39;ll pay higher total interest over the life of your loan.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Interest rate type. <\/strong>Mortgage rates come with two basic types of rates \u2014 fixed and variable. Fixed-rate mortgages offer a consistent interest rate over the life of your loan, whereas adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) often start with a lower fixed rate for an agreed-on time and then adjust to a variable rate based on market conditions for the remainder of your term. Choosing between these two rates depends on your financial goals and tolerance for risk.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2 id=\"jump-link-frequently-asked-questions-about-mortgage-rates\">Frequently asked questions about mortgage rates<\/h2>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-are-mortgage-lenders\"><strong>What are mortgage lenders? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Lenders are financial institutions that loan money to homebuyers. A lender is different from a loan servicer, which typically handles the operational tasks of your loan, like processing payments, talking directly with borrowers and sending monthly statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-does-it-mean-to-refinance-a-mortgage\"><strong>What does it mean to refinance a mortgage?<\/strong>&nbsp;<\/h3>\n<p>Refinancing is a process of trading in your current mortgage to another lender for lower rates and better terms than your current loan. With a refinance, the new lender pays off your old mortgage and you then pay your monthly statements from the new lender.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-what-factors-influence-mortgage-rates\"><strong>What factors influence mortgage rates? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Mortgage rates are determined by many factors that include inflation rates, economic conditions, housing market trends and the Federal Reserve&#39;s target interest rate. Lenders also consider your personal credit score, the amount available for your down payment, the property you&#39;re interested in and other terms of the loan you&#39;re requesting, like 30-year or 15-year offers.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-when-is-the-best-time-to-lock-in-a-mortgage-rate\"><strong>When is the best time to lock in a mortgage rate? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Mortgage rates can fluctuate daily, so it&#39;s best to lock in a rate when you&#39;re comfortable with the offered rate and conditions of the loan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-why-are-mortgage-rates-so-high\">Why are mortgage rates so high?<\/h3>\n<p>Mortgage rates are influenced by complicated factors like inflation, employment rates, the bond market and the overall economy. While the Federal Reserve doesn&#39;t set mortgage rates, this central bank of the U.S. sets benchmark rates that indirectly affect rates on financial products like mortgages, personal loans and deposit accounts.<\/p>\n<p>March inflation data came in higher than expectations, which is among the main concerns driving mortgage rates higher in April.<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-can-i-negotiate-my-mortgage-rate\"><strong>Can I negotiate my mortgage rate? <\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>It&#39;s not likely \u2014 lenders consider the market conditions and other financial factors when determining rates. You can, however, ask about how you can reduce costs in other ways when comparing mortgage lenders. For instance, many lenders offer lower rates in exchange for &quot;mortgage points&quot; \u2014 upfront fees you pay to your lender. A mortgage point could cost 1% of your mortgage amount, which means about $5,000 on a $500,000 home loan, with each point lowering your interest rate by about 0.25%, depending on your lender and loan.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"37734d4905894e2dabe503c5246897a4\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.myfinance.com\/as\/380044bc-da8a-4c87-ba55-7cfd4559b93f?utm_medium=embed&amp;imr=https:\/\/www.aol.com\/&amp;utm_campaign=aolsyndication-heloc-multi&amp;subId=PLACEVUIDHERE\" class=\"myFinance-iframe\" title=\"Advertisement\" id=\"myfiWidget_5\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p><em>Editor&#39;s note: Annual percentage yields shown are as of Thursday, April 25, 2024, at 7:40 a.m. ET.

        "description": "<p>By Jarrett Renshaw and Nandita Bose <\/p><p>  WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. President Joe Biden traveled to Syracuse, New York, on Thursday and announced a preliminary agreement with memory chip maker Micron Technology for up to $6.14 billion in subsidies for two chip factories. <\/p><p>  The agreement signed by the U.S. Commerce Department will fund facilities in New York and Idaho under the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which aims to boost domestic manufacturing of chips and reduce reliance on supplies from China and Taiwan. <\/p><p>  Biden said the United States used to have 40% of the chips market but over time production moved outside the country and the pandemic exposed weaknesses in the U.S. supply chain that hurt critical industries. <\/p><p>  &quot;I&#39;m determined that I&#39;m never going to let us be vulnerable to wait lines again, what is essential is we&#39;re going to make it here in America together,&quot; Biden said. <\/p><p>  The Commerce Department said the federal grants would support the construction of a fabrication plant, or fab, in Clay, New York, a first step toward Micron&#39;s plans to invest about $100 billion in New York and create 13,500 jobs. <\/p><p>  The grants also provide initial funding for a facility in Boise, Idaho, unlocking a planned $25 billion investment in a fab to be co-located with Micron&#39;s research and development facilities there and should create 6,500 jobs, Commerce said. <\/p><p>  Micron&#39;s investment will be the &quot;largest private investment in New York and Idaho&#39;s history,&quot; and will create over 70,000 jobs, including 20,000 direct construction and manufacturing jobs and tens of thousands of indirect jobs,&quot; the White House said. <\/p><p>  Biden, who is running for re-election in November&#39;s presidential election, used his visit to Syracuse to tout his administration&#39;s efforts to revitalize U.S. manufacturing and strengthen national security. <\/p><p>  &quot;American manufacturing is back, new factories are going up all across the country, and communities like Syracuse are writing the great American comeback story,&quot; Biden said. <\/p><p>  In the evening, the president will speak at a campaign event in Westchester County, New York. <\/p><p>  Biden signed the $52.7 billion CHIPS bill in August 2022 to subsidize U.S. semiconductor production and research. Semiconductors were invented in the United States, but domestic companies produce only about 10% of the world&#39;s chips and none of the most advanced ones. <\/p><p>  The White House said Thursday&#39;s announcement also included at least $40 million in funds for training and workforce development, as well as creation of four more workforce hubs in upstate New York, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Michigan. <\/p><p>  Under the agreement, Micron committed to providing affordable high-quality childcare for its workers across its facilities. <\/p><p>  The company also affirmed &quot;workers&#39; rights to organize, to share feedback without fear of reprisal, and to collectively bargain,&quot; the White House said. <\/p><p>  (Reporting by Jarrret Renshaw, Nandita Bose and Andrea Shalal; Editing by Tom Hogue and Diane Craft) <\/p>",

After that, you\u2019ll pay back the amount you borrowed in installments.<\/p>\n<p>Your home is the collateral for the line of credit, which means falling behind on payments puts your home at risk of foreclosure.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"how-they-work\">How does a HELOC work?<\/h2>\n<p>When you\u2019re approved for a HELOC, you\u2019ll be given a credit limit based on your available <a data-i13n=\"cpos:1;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/what-is-home-equity\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">equity in your home<\/a>. Borrowers can usually tap up to 80 percent of their home\u2019s value (sometimes as much as 85 or 90 percent, depending on lender policy and if they\u2019re very well-qualified), minus outstanding mortgage balances.<\/p>\n<p>During an initial <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/heloc-refinance-draw-period-ends\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">draw period<\/a>, you can spend the funds using dedicated checks, a draw debit card or online transfer. You\u2019ll need to make monthly interest payments on the amount you borrow, but as you pay back your HELOC, the funds will be replenished. This draw period typically lasts 10 years.<\/p>\n<p>After that, you\u2019ll enter a repayment period, during which you\u2019ll no longer be able to access funds and instead need to repay the principal and any outstanding interest. Most HELOC plans allow you to repay the remaining balance over a period of 10 years to 20 years.<\/p>\n<p>While you\u2019ll often only be on the hook for interest payments during the draw period, you can pay both principal and interest during this phase if you choose. This can help keep your payments manageable when you enter the repayment period.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cMaximize your HELOC by reviewing your balance during the draw period to make sure you aren\u2019t overspending,\u201d says Linda Bell, senior writer on Bankrate\u2019s Home Lending team. \u201cTo manage payments effectively, you can explore options such as interest-only payments or fixed-rate conversions. By incorporating HELOC payments into your long-term financial plan, you can protect your financial well-being and keep your home safe from potential risks.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"why-they-are-popular\">Why HELOCs are popular in 2024<\/h2>\n<p>Though originations are off the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.transunion.com\/content\/dam\/transunion\/global\/business\/documents\/fs2024\/ciir-mortgage-report.pdf?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">10-year high they hit in 2022<\/a>, HELOC activity remains well above its pre-pandemic level. Part of the appeal of HELOCs lies in their flexibility \u2013 funds can be tapped on an as-needed basis, providing homeowners a cushion against unexpected expenses. Borrowers appreciate the option to take out only what they require and pay interest only on what they use.<\/p>\n<p>Also, while their interest rates have risen, HELOCs still remain less expensive than other forms of consumer debt, like credit cards and personal loans. And, unlike a cash-out refinance \u2014 the old <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/heloc-replaces-cash-out-refinance\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">go-to way to tap a homeownership stake<\/a> \u2014 HELOCs allow a homeowner to hang onto a mortgage with a low interest rate.<\/p>\n<p>HELOC originations did drop in 2023, due to a rise in their rates \u2014 the benchmark $30,000 HELOC even spiked above the psychologically important 10 percent barrier in November and December. But rates retreated in the new year, and Bankrate forecasts they\u2019ll <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/home-equity-rates-forecast\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">continue to drop throughout 2024<\/a>, mirroring the Federal Reserve\u2019s anticipated lowering of the primary federal funds rate. \u201cA decline in HELOC rates will be spurred primarily by Fed rate cuts,\u201d says Greg McBride, chief financial analyst at Bankrate. But also, \u201cdeclining mortgage rates and ongoing economic growth will bring about more introductory rate offers on HELOCs, so the average HELOC rate will be down more substantially.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>A drop in rates would naturally encourage more equity-rich homeowners to turn to HELOCs as a financing tool. And Americans have plenty of equity to tap: As of February 2024, the average mortgage-holder has <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.blackknightinc.com\/data-reports\/february-2024-mortgage-monitor\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">$193,000 in available home equity funds<\/a>, according to data analyst ICE Mortgage Technology.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"card-body\"><strong>\ud83c\udfe0 What is the current average HELOC rate?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>As of April 24, 2024, the average rate for a $30,000 HELOC is 9.07%, with rates ranging from <a data-i13n=\"cpos:7;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/heloc-rates\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">8.51% to 10.39%<\/a>. Various factors can influence the actual rate you receive, such as your creditworthiness, lender and loan terms.Rates for home equity lines of credit are variable, tied to an interest-rate index that fluctuates. The interest rate on your HELOC will reflect the performance of that index, reflecting its interest rates, plus an additional markup of several percentage points that your lender tacks on. While some lenders offer fixed-rate HELOCs, these often come with higher interest rates overall.<\/p>\n<p>To secure the lowest possible rate, compare quotes from multiple lenders and keep an eye out for introductory teaser rate promotions. Some lenders may advertise an introductory rate, a temporarily reduced APR for well-qualified borrowers, which could last for six or 12 months or up to a predetermined date. After this period, a higher rate will go into effect.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<div id=\"d577576ca87349f48bf9a6d311b096b3\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.myfinance.com\/as\/380044bc-da8a-4c87-ba55-7cfd4559b93f?utm_medium=embed&amp;imr=https:\/\/www.aol.com\/&amp;utm_campaign=aolsyndication-heloc-multi&amp;subId=PLACEVUIDHERE\" class=\"myFinance-iframe\" title=\"Advertisement\" id=\"myfiWidget_5\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2 id=\"requirements\">HELOC requirements<\/h2>\n<p>There\u2019s no one-size-fits all set of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:8;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/requirements-to-borrow-from-home-equity\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">requirements<\/a> to qualify for a HELOC.

The specific methods depend on the lender you choose.<\/p>\n<p>When considering how to use your HELOC, there are a few more details to keep in mind:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Minimum draw requirements and potential fees:<\/strong> Some HELOCs mandate minimum withdrawals, impose transaction fees each time you access funds or charge an annual maintenance fee. It\u2019s wise to clarify these terms with your lender beforehand.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Withdrawals:<\/strong> To manage your finances effectively, withdraw only the amount you need and make timely payments. This helps you minimize interest charges and can positively influence your credit score.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Repaying the principal:<\/strong> Many HELOCs allow you to make minimal, interest-only repayments during the draw period.

Typically, lenders will allow you to borrow up to 80 to 90 percent of your home equity.<\/p>\n<p>For example, if your home is valued at $300,000 and your mortgage balance is $200,000, you have $100,000 in equity. If the lender demands you keep 20 percent of that stake untapped, you could have a line of credit of $80,000.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t have to use the full amount of your HELOC all at once. You can choose to spend part of your allowable credit, and the remaining amount will still be available for you to use in the future. For instance, if you have $100,000 in available credit and only use $65,000, you\u2019ll still have $35,000 left in your credit line. You\u2019re only required to pay back the portion of credit you use.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>&nbsp;Maximize your HELOC by reviewing your balance during the draw period to make sure you aren\u2019t overspending. \u2014 Linda Bell, Senior Writer, Bankrate&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-how-to-calculate-your-heloc-borrowing-limit\">How to calculate your HELOC borrowing limit<\/h3>\n<p>When considering your HELOC application, lenders look at the equity you have in your home. Equity is the value of your home minus what you still owe on your mortgage.<\/p>\n<p>Say your home appraised at $375,000 and you still owe $150,000 on your mortgage. Your total equity, then, would be $225,000 ($375,000 \u2013 $150,000).<\/p>\n<p>You can also determine your level of equity by calculating your <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/mortgages\/what-is-loan-to-value-ratio-ltv\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">loan-to-value ratio (<\/a>LTV). Simply divide $150,000 by $375,000, then multiply by 100 for a percentage. In this case, you\u2019d have a 40 percent LTV ratio. This means you\u2019d have 60 percent equity (or $225,000) in your home.<\/p>\n<p>With a HELOC, you can usually borrow up to 80 percent of your combined LTV (CLTV). The CLTV takes into account the value of your home and what you owe on your first mortgage, plus the maximum you want to borrow via the HELOC: the combined total of all your home-based debt, in other words.<\/p>\n<p>Say your lender allows up to an 80 percent CLTV. Using the above example:<\/p>\n<p class=\"card-body\"><\/p>\n<p><strong>$375,000 x 0.80 (80%) = $300,000$300,000 \u2013 $150,000 (balance of first mortgage) = $150,000 <\/strong><\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n<p>So, even though your total equity stake is worth $225,000, your HELOC borrowing limit would be $150,000.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"cost\">How much does a HELOC cost?<\/h2>\n<p>The cost of a HELOC can vary depending on a number of factors, including the lender, the terms of the loan, interest rates and the amount borrowed. And then there are any extra expenses, aka closing costs: origination fees, application fees, appraisal fees. Some HELOCs also carry annual fees, a charge for locking in your interest rate, and an early termination penalty, if you close the credit line within a year or two of opening it, or before the repayment period ends.<\/p>\n<p>You can get a sense of these fees\u2019 cumulative costs by comparing a HELOC\u2019s current interest rate with its current annual percentage rate, or APR, when you start looking around. The APR factors in both interest and other charges. Sometimes the difference can be a full percentage point, or even more.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cComparison-shop with <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/heloc-lenders?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">at least three lenders <\/a>and before choosing one, make sure you consider all of the loan costs, not just one aspect, like the closing costs or interest rate,\u201d says Bell. \u201cKnowing all of the costs upfront can help you plan your budget and avoid any nasty surprises down the road.\u201d<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"pros-v-cons\">What are the pros and cons of a HELOC?<\/h2>\n<p>The <a data-i13n=\"cpos:16;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/pros-cons-of-home-equity-lines\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">pros and cons of a HELOC<\/a> include:<\/p>\n<h3 id=\"jump-link-pros-of-helocs\">Pros of HELOCs<\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Flexibility:<\/strong> While you\u2019ll be approved for a maximum HELOC amount, you don\u2019t need to use all of it, or use it all at once.

Common reasons include a low credit score, insufficient income, high debt-to-income ratio, or not enough home equity.<\/p>\n<p>Following your denial, consider these steps:<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Request a letter of denial:<\/strong> You have the right to receive a <a data-i13n=\"cpos:22;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.consumercomplianceoutlook.org\/2013\/second-quarter\/adverse-action-notice-requirements-under-ecoa-fcra\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">written explanation or letter of denial<\/a> from the lender, which outlines the reason for the rejection. This letter can provide clarity on financial areas to focus on for future applications.<\/p>\n<p><strong>2. Address the reason for the denial:<\/strong> Once you understand why you were denied, you can take steps to rectify the situation. For example, if your credit score was a factor, you might focus on improving it by paying bills on time, reducing outstanding balances, or correcting any credit report errors. If insufficient income was the issue, you could look into a side hustle or perhaps a gift or forgivable loan from family.<\/p>\n<p><strong>3. Reevaluate the home:<\/strong> Sometimes the fault, dear borrower, is not in you but in your home. If the appraisal deemed it insufficient to secure the credit line (or as big a line as you wanted), examine it carefully for mistakes (did they get the square footage wrong? Mis-count the number of bedrooms? Use outdated comps?) You could also get a second appraisal, albeit at your own expense.<\/p>\n<p><strong>4. Talk to other lenders:<\/strong> Different lenders have different risk tolerances and qualification standards for HELOCs \u2014 there are those that <a data-i13n=\"cpos:23;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/home-equity-loan-bad-credit\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">specialize in bad-credit applicants<\/a> \u2014 so taking your business elsewhere might bring you better luck.<\/p>\n<p><strong>5.

But the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:27;pos:1\" href=\"http:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/mortgages\/cash-out-refinance-rates\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">rate might be a lot higher<\/a> than your original mortgage \u2014 depending on when you got it \u2014 and the application process might be more onerous.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Remember, each option comes with its own terms, and the choice depends on your individual circumstances and financial needs.<\/p>\n<p>A rule of thumb following a HELOC denial is to wait approximately six months before submitting a new credit application \u2014 to the same lender, at least.<\/p>\n<h2 id=\"faq\">Home equity line of credit FAQ<\/h2>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Is it better to get a HELOC or a home equity loan? <\/strong>It depends on your goals. A HELOC could be better than a home equity loan if you want a source of funds you can access on an as-needed basis. The line-of-credit arrangement also means you\u2019ll only pay interest on the amount you borrow, at least initially. With a home equity loan, you\u2019ll be responsible for interest on the entire loan balance, even if you don\u2019t use all the funds. If you\u2019re planning to cover a significant but indeterminate expense in the near future and want to have a pool of cash readily available, a HELOC might also be the better choice. That\u2019s only if you don\u2019t mind a variable interest rate, however (unless the lender offers otherwise), and a fluctuating monthly payment.<br><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>How does a HELOC affect your credit score?<\/strong>Your lender will conduct a hard credit check when you apply for a HELOC, which can cause a slight, temporary decrease in your <a data-i13n=\"cpos:28;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/does-heloc-affect-credit-score\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">credit score<\/a>. This type of credit check typically stays on your credit reports for two years, though it might only impact your credit score for up to a year. Apart from that, the way you use and repay your HELOC could impact your score. Borrowing against a HELOC can increase your credit utilization ratio, which factors into your credit score. A higher credit utilization ratio could result in a lower credit score. That said, paying down your HELOC over time could help you build credit.<br><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>What is the typical length of a HELOC?<\/strong>The typical length of a HELOC is up to 30 years, with the draw period up to 10 years. Some lenders also provide the option to renew or <a data-i13n=\"cpos:29;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/ways-to-refinance-heloc\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">refinance your HELOC<\/a> once the repayment term ends.<br><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>How do HELOC interest rates work?<\/strong>You\u2019ll almost always encounter variable interest rates with HELOCs, The variable interest rates on HELOCs are partly determined by benchmark indexes, like the U.S. prime rate. The prime rate is set by individual banks and influenced by fluctuations in the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:30;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/banking\/federal-reserve\/what-is-the-federal-funds-rate\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">federal funds rate<\/a> (the rate that banks charge other banks for short-term loans). For HELOCs, lenders typically take the benchmark\u2019s interest rate and add several percentage points to it to come up with your credit line\u2019s interest rate.Some lenders offer <a data-i13n=\"cpos:31;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/heloc-with-fixed-rate-option\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">fixed-rate HELOCs<\/a>, which allow you to lock in a portion of your HELOC balance with a set, unchanging interest rate. This essentially converts part of your HELOC into a home equity loan. With a fixed rate, you won\u2019t need to worry about your interest rate increasing over time.<br><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>What is the monthly payment on a $50,000 HELOC?<\/strong>If you take out a HELOC with a $50,000 limit and draw the full amount, your monthly payment will depend on whether you make interest-only payments or interest and principal payments to start.Say the HELOC has a 9 percent interest rate and you plan to pay it off in 20 years. You\u2019d need to pay $453 per month to reach that goal.If you want to explore a scenario of your own, use our <a data-i13n=\"cpos:32;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/home-equity\/heloc-calculator\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">HELOC payoff calculator<\/a>.<br><\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>HELOC vs. other equity loan options<\/strong>There are two main alternatives to a HELOC: a home equity loan or cash-out refinancing.

For example, an <a data-i13n=\"cpos:2;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/how-to-buy-sp-500-index-fund\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">S&amp;P 500 index fund<\/a> tracks the collective performance of the hundreds of companies in the S&amp;P 500. If the S&amp;P 500 is up 5 percent in a year, the fund should be close to that, too.<\/p>\n<p>Index funds are typically <a data-i13n=\"cpos:3;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/active-versus-passive\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">passively managed<\/a>, meaning there is no active manager to pay. Rather than trying to bet on individual stocks to beat the market, an index fund simply aims to \u201cbe the market\u201d with an autopilot approach that holds the same securities in the same proportion as the index. Here\u2019s the kicker: Most active fund managers actually fail to beat the market and instead underperform their target index. Why pay more for less when you can take advantage of the track record of a broad-based market index?<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Popular types of index funds<\/strong><\/h2>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>U.S. stock indexes<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The <a data-i13n=\"cpos:4;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/what-is-sp-500\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">S&amp;P 500 index<\/a> is one of the most used benchmarks for stocks focused on large U.S.-based companies. While the companies in the S&amp;P account for approximately 80 percent of the total value of the U.S. stock market, some investors opt for extended market index funds that help track that remaining 20 percent. The Russell 1000 index tracks the 1,000 biggest U.S. stocks, and the FT Wilshire 5000 index effectively represents every publicly traded stock in the country.<\/p>\n<p>The Nasdaq 100 is another popular index because it contains major tech companies such as <a data-i13n=\"cpos:5;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/how-to-buy-apple-stock\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">Apple<\/a> and <a data-i13n=\"cpos:6;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/how-to-buy-amazon-stock\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">Amazon<\/a>, and has delivered high returns for years.<\/p>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>International stock indexes<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Investors can seek to capitalize on growth opportunities throughout the rest of the world, too, via a plethora of index funds that track equities in developed and emerging markets across the globe.

Dividend indexes include only stocks that pay a dividend, and the ETFs are a popular way for investors to get access to a diversified portfolio of dividend-paying companies.<\/p>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>How to invest in index funds: Two key factors<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Index funds are available to anyone who wants to invest money. ETFs typically require a purchase of at least one share, though <a data-i13n=\"cpos:11;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/best-brokers-fractional-share-investing\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">brokers offering fractional shares<\/a> can help you get around that. But index mutual funds may ask for an initial deposit of $1,000 or more. Many of these index funds track the same index, so it\u2019s important to pay attention to two key factors when comparing them.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>The expense ratio: <\/strong>Because index funds have no active manager involved, they tend to have rock-bottom expenses. Still, there is a cost associated. Be sure to compare the <a data-i13n=\"cpos:12;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/what-is-an-expense-ratio\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">expense ratio<\/a> to understand how much of your investment will go toward the administrative and operating costs of the fund.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>The tracking error:<\/strong> Look at the past performance of the fund, too. How well did it match the index? If it has a high tracking error \u2014 an indication of how far off it fell from mirroring the index \u2014 you\u2019ll want to look for other funds that have historically managed to keep a better pace with the index.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<div id=\"d17a8e05cb2540d3844cd46881dba65a\"><iframe src=\"https:\/\/www.myfinance.com\/as\/5c1192e6-acd6-4ae4-ae53-ce803c34eb97?utm_medium=embed&amp;imr=https:\/\/www.aol.com\/&amp;utm_campaign=aolsyndication-investing-multi&amp;subId=PLACEVUIDHERE\" class=\"myFinance-iframe\" title=\"Advertisement\" id=\"myfiWidget_3\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border:none;overflow:hidden;\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Pros and cons of index funds<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>No matter where you invest your money, you should think about the potential upsides and downsides.

In 2022, the asset-weighted average expense ratio on stock index mutual funds was just 0.05 percent \u2014 a bargain price that is tough to beat. Meanwhile, index ETFs came in at a still-cheap 0.16 percent on an asset-weighted basis.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Instant diversification:<\/strong> Instead of trying to pick individual stocks or bonds, an index fund offers a chance to <a data-i13n=\"cpos:13;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/diversification-is-important-in-investing\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">spread your bet across a wide pool of investment opportunities<\/a>. In the words of Jack Bogle, the late founder of <a data-i13n=\"cpos:14;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/brokerage-reviews\/vanguard\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">Vanguard<\/a>, index fund investing means buying the whole haystack rather than looking for the needle in the haystack.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>More tax efficiencies:<\/strong> Because index funds aren\u2019t constantly buying and selling securities, a regular routine in actively managed funds, they don\u2019t generate surprise taxable <a data-i13n=\"cpos:15;pos:1\" href=\"https:\/\/www.bankrate.com\/investing\/long-term-capital-gains-tax\/?mf_ct_campaign=aol-synd-feed&amp;utm_content=syndication\">capital gains distributions<\/a>.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Better informed:<\/strong> The securities that make up an index are public knowledge. For example, if a new company joins the S&amp;P 500, you\u2019ll be aware. That\u2019s a key distinction from actively managed funds where the fund manager might bet on a company with an unproven track record, and you have no idea.<\/p><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Cons<\/strong><\/h3>\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Market cap weighting can weigh down a fund: <\/strong>An index fund can get bloated with overweighted stocks, which means it isn\u2019t quite as diversified as you might expect. For example, consider the S&amp;P 500 index, where more than 30 percent of its holdings are in the 10 biggest companies. So, the fortune of these funds is significantly tilted toward those major market players.<\/p><\/li>\n<li><p><strong>Inability to sell:<\/strong> This isn\u2019t technically a drawback, but it is an important lesson of index fund investing. These are not designed for frequent trading. Some mutual fund companies may charge fees for any index fund shares sold within a certain time frame \u2014 for example, 90 days of purchase. That shouldn\u2019t scare you off, though: They do this to minimize trading and administrative expenses to hold costs down for all investors in the fund.
